\end{longtable}Dear Mrs. Choi:

According to our contract signed by you on September 24th, 2013, we have prepared the following Self-Contained report for the property represented as belonging to Juliet Choi. The subject property consists of six paintings and a woodblock print .


You provided us with the information that indicates that the Brown family owns the subject properties listed above in their entirety. I examined the property in your presence at 7445 Girard Avenue, \#6, La Jolla, CA.


This appraisal report provides the appraisal conclusion of Fair Market Value for the intended use of Estate Tax.(Unexpected XTag: NTree (XTag "br" []) [])Fair Market Value is defined as `The price at which the property would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to buy or sell and both having reasonable knowledge of relevant facts. The fair market value of a particular item of property includible in the decedent’s gross estate is not to be determined by a forced sale price. Nor is the fair market value of an item of property to be determined by the sale price of the item in a market other than that in which such item is most commonly sold to the public, taking into account the location of the item wherever appropriate.’’ 26 CFR Estate Tax Regulation 20.2031-1(b).


After thorough consideration of available facts and statistics, the Fair Market Value for the subject property is \textbf{one hundred seventy two thousand seven hundred five dollars (\$172,705 with 6 unappraised items)}. The effective date of value for this appraisal is September 10th, 2008. This professional opinion is based upon my knowledge and experience in the valuation of fine arts. This appraisal is based on my research and analysis of the property and knowledge of relevant markets where the property are traded.


This is a Self-Contained that was prepared to conform to the Code of Ethics of the American Society of Appraisers and the current version of the \emph{Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice, the 2012-2013 Edition} (USPAP), published by the Appraisal Foundation. I have no past, present or contemplated future interest in the property included in this report. my fee was not contingent on any value finding.


This \pageref{LastPage} page report consists of a letter of transmittal, scope of work, definitions, privacy statement, assumptions and limiting conditions, certification, description, photographs, narrative, glossary, bibliography and credentials. All these elements must be present for the value conclusion to be valid.


The information in this report is confidential. All notes, electronic, work copies and photographs remain the property of the appraiser and are retained for five years, and/or two years after the conclusion of any litigation. All documents are shredded or otherwise defaced prior to disposal.


The submission of this report completes my assignment and obligations. Any further consultation, preparation of additional reports, testimony, or appearances in court or before any governmental forum in reference to the property described in this appraisal will require additional fees to cover the required services. The aforementioned fees will be billed at the rate commensurate with the timing of the appraisal.


Thank you for allowing us to be of service to you.

\authorsignature\newpage{}\newpage{}\section{Scope of Work}
Thompson \& Martinez Fine Art Appraisals, Inc. was hired by ~ to reach an opinion of the Fair Market Value of seven artworks by Zhang Daqian belonging to the Choi family. Based on my discussion with Client, as well as the intended use of the report, the type and location of the subject properties and the effective date of valuation, the Appraiser has selected the type of value, the relevant market, the information researched and the analysis to be applied. To complete this assignment I consulted authoritative publications and on-line sources, reviewed published and on-line market data and interviewed knowledgeable dealers and others regarding the subject properties and their relevant markets.


This report is intended to be an objective, independent, unbiased and credible analysis of known facts. During the course of my examination, research and analysis, I have endeavored to be accurate and to use due diligence. This opinion of value was developed using appraisal methods that are within the accepted standard of care for the appraisal profession and within the boundaries of typical practice.


This appraisal document states the majority of information analyzed, the appraisal procedures followed, and the reasoning that supports the analysis, opinions and conclusions under the requirements of the \emph{Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice, the 2012-2013 Edition} (USPAP). It is considered a summary report. The documentation substantiating the value reported is held in the appraiser’s files.

\newpage{}\section{Type of Value}
This report serves as documented evidence of this appraiser having witnessed the subject property and identified, described and valued the subject property in the context of determining Fair Market Value. \section{Intended Use}
The intended use of this report, as stipulated, is to evaluate the subject properties and provide an assessment of Fair Market Value of a collection of contemporary art for the intended use of Estate Tax. No other use is valid or condoned.\section{Intended Users of this report}
The intended users of this report are: Mrs. Juliet Choi and the IRS. There are no other intended users or uses.\section{Definition of Value}
Fair Market Value is defined as ``The price at which the property would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to buy or sell and both having reasonable knowledge of relevant facts. The fair market value of a particular item of property includible in the decedent’s gross estate is not to be determined by a forced sale price. Nor is the fair market value of an item of property to be determined by the sale price of the item in a market other than that in which such item is most commonly sold to the public, taking into account the location of the item wherever appropriate.’’ 26 CFR Estate Tax Regulation 20.2031-1(b).\section{Approaches to Value}
For this appraisal three valuation methods were considered (from Soucy and Smith, eds, \emph{The Appraisal of Personal Property – Principles, Theories, and Practice Methods for the Professional Appraiser}, 1994.). The three valuation methods are:\begin{compactitem}\item[$\bullet$]\textbf{Cost Approach to Value} method estimates either the reproduction or replacement of a property, either new or depreciated.\item[$\bullet$]\textbf{Income Approach to Value} method estimates the present worth of anticipated future benefits of owning income producing properties or objects.\item[$\bullet$]\textbf{Market Comparison Approach to Value} method estimates value by comparison with properties sold in the relevant market with adjustments for all differences that affect value, such as differences in characteristics of value, in market layer, and in time exposed to the market in order to arrive at the most apposite estimate of value.\end{compactitem}For this appraisal three valuation methods were considered. The three valuation methods are (as defined by The American Society of Appraisers handbook, Principles of Valuation: Personal Property Valuation Methodology – Research and Analysis):


\begin{compactitem}
\item[$\bullet$]Cost Approach to Value method estimates either the reproduction or replacement of a property, either new or depreciated.
\item[$\bullet$]Income Approach to Value method estimates the present worth of anticipated future benefits of owning income producing properties or objects.
\item[$\bullet$]Market Comparison Approach to Value method estimates value by comparison with properties sold in the relevant market with adjustments for all differences that affect value, such as differences in characteristics of value, in market layer, and in time exposed to the market in order to arrive at the most apposite estimate of value.
\end{compactitem}
The Market Comparison Approach was chosen for this assignment. The Cost and Income Approaches to value were considered but not appropriate to this assignment. Although the cost approach would be able to replicate the subject properties in form, it would not have represented their age, history and desirability. The income approach also was not appropriate because an income could not easily be derived from these properties. The properties have been placed in the appropriate level of the market considering properties of similar quality, period, style, significance, condition, rarity, and utility, based on market data and comparable sales gathered in the appropriate markets. Market data includes auction records, retail and private sales, dealer’s inventories, catalogues, published price lists and price guides. The appraisers relied on contacts, field notes and conversations with other professionals in this field. Sources are listed at the end of the report.

\subsection{Market Overview}

Zhang Daqian is recognized as one of China’s modern masters. He is not only revered for his great skill in the techniques and styles of classical Chinese painting (he was also a notorious forger), but also for developing a new style of painting, merging Eastern and Western media of gouache and ink and colors on paper to create a hybrid Eastern-Western expressionist style. His career can be divided into two periods: before 1949 when he lived in China and produced work in the traditional manner, and after 1949, when he briefly stayed in Hong Kong and Macau and then moved to Brazil and finally on to Taiwan where he lived until his death. The paintings in the Choi family collection date from the 1930s and 1940s and are in the traditional style. The provenance of the collection is excellent. The paintings have been passed down directly to Mrs. Juliet Choi from her late father-in-law, Choi Hac-ting, who acquired the paintings from the artist as gifts and commissions. Additionally, evidence of the relationship between the Choi family and the painter is found in the inscriptions of the paintings, several of which mention family members. Additional documentation of the relationship between the artist and the Choi family is an article published by the Cultural Affairs office of Macau which recounts the three month period in 1949 when Zhang Daqian stayed at the Choi family compound in Macau (Choi San, “Zhang Daqian’s Artistic Activities in Macau”, http://www.icm.gov.mo/exhibition.daqian.Activity.asp)


The date of valuation, September 10th, 2008, falls at an unusual time in the global economy and the Chinese art market. A graph of Chinese art sales at auction in Appendix A indicates that the Chinese art market grew steadily from from 2004 through 2008, peaking in Spring, 2008. It appears that the global Autumn sales of Chinese art taken as a whole, was barely affected by the the global financial crisis as it unfolded after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers on September 15th. Moreover, according to a report by Art Market Monitor of Artron (AMMA), “Art Market in China in 2012 - A Dialogue between East and West”, (p. 55) in 2009 the market entered a three year boom period which peaked in 2011. Art Economics, a research company that studies the international market, reports that after peaking in 2011, reported revenues of Chinese art sold at auction dropped off 24 percent in 2012, and that 2013 is expected to be modestly better than 2012. (“Forging an Art Market in China”, New York Times, October 28th, 2013.)


As one of China’s modern masters, and one of the global art market’s top grossing artists at auction, the market for Zhang Daqian’s work has tracked the accelerating trajectory of the overall Chinese art market.(Appendix B). Zhang Daqian was a prolific painter, and, in any given year hundreds of his paintings (both authentic and fakes) come up at auction. Works can sell from the tens of thousands up to the tens of millions. On May 31st, 2011, a set of four hanging scrolls in ink and color on paper “Lotus and Mandarin Ducks” (1947), (each 72.64 inches x 37.40 inches) sold at Sotheby’s, Hong Kong for \$24,513,000. In 2011, Zhang Daqian was the top-selling artist in the world at auction with reported sales of \$782.4 million, but in 2012 reported sales of his works fell to \$241.6 million (AMMA, 2012, p. ).


One important reason for this recent decline is that the Chinese art market is dysfunctional. According to a recent New York Times article, “Forging an Art Market in China” October 28th, 2013, “... a six-month review...found that many of the sales — transactions reported to have produced as much as a third of the country’s auction revenue in recent years — did not actually take place.” Moreover, “the market is flooded with forgeries, often mass-produced, and has become a breeding ground for corruption, as business executives curry favor with officials by bribing them with art.” The Zhang Daqian painting market is part and parcel of this environment.


In 2008, the Chinese art market had not yet entered this period of rapid price acceleration and widespread speculation, fraud and corruption. From 2004 to 2008 the market held steady. Zhang Daqian was considered a blue chip artist and his works commanded top prices at auction. The highest price paid for a Zhang Daqian painting during this period was October 24th, 2005 when an abstract landscape from his later career, “Snowcapped Mountains in Switzerland”, 1967, sold for US\$1,932,990, HKD15,800,00 through Sotheby’s Hong Kong. In 2008, the top selling Zhang Daqian paintings came from both his early and later career: a splashed ink and color on canvas abstract landscape, “Cross-Island Highway Taiwan” from the post-1949 period, selling for \$1,077,47.00 (HKD 8,391,500) through Sotheby’s Hong Kong on April 8th, 2008, and a traditional style landscape in the manner of canonical painter, Wang Meng which sold for US\$975,120 (HKD 7,707,500) through Christies, Hong Kong on May 26, 2008.


The paintings in the Choi collection are all traditional style paintings from his early career. The finest painting in the collection is “Hunting in Autumn”. It is a rare work with numerous inscriptions and seals of the artist with an excellent provenance. It occupies the top market level which, in 2008, was between \$500,000 and \$1 million dollars. The two Tang-Song style figure paintings of deities are also highly desirable due to their rarity, subject matter and inscriptions. These works occupied Zhang Daqian’s middle market level which in 2008 was between \$100,000 and \$500,000. The remaining paintings, the two bird on branch paintings, fan and signed woodblock print occupy the lower market level which, in 2008, was between \$10,000 and \$100,000.

\newpage{}\subsection{Biography}

Zhang Daqian was one of the leading artists to emerge in China in the early twentieth century. Born into a family of artists in Sichuan, China, he studied textile dyeing techniques in Kyoto, Japan and returned to establish a successful career selling his paintings in Shanghai. A staunch supporter of the Kuomintang, he left China in 1948 and moved to Mogi das Cruzes, Brazil, and then to Carmel, California, before finally settling in Taipei, Taiwan.


In his early career he was an expert in the techniques and styles of ancient masters. In the 1940s he sought to revive the ancient Chinese painting found at Tang Dynasty Buddhist cave sites at Dunhuang and Yulin where he copied Buddhist wall paintings. During the Sino-Japanese War, the artist continued his study of traditional Tang-Song figure painting and ancient monumental landscape painting. His love of tradition was also reflected in his personal collection of ancient Chinese paintings, which he began early in his career. At its peak, his collection contained several hundred works from the Tang to Qing dynasties. In the 1960s, after he had emigrated from China to Brazil, he came under the influence of Abstract expressionists and his style changed radically to abstract compositions of landscapes in splashed ink and colors.

\end{longtable}\paragraph{Description:}
A ink and color on paper painting of Lakshmi after a Tang Dynasty wall mural at the Yulin Caves at Anxi.\paragraph{Market Analysis:}
According to Arnold Chang, the subject property is a good work of a type much sought after by collectors with an excellent provenance. It is a work from the 1940s when Zhang Daqian famously went to the Buddhist caves at Dunhuang to study and produce paintings after the Buddhist subjects there. According to Mr. Chang, these early Dunhuang paintings rarely appeared at auction prior to 2009, so this work would have been very appealing to the market in September 2008.


A search of auction records yielded three similar era and subject matter paintings. A figure of a Bodhisattva copied from a Buddhist mural at the Mogao Caves at Dunhuang (128 cm x 63 cm) sold through Beijing Rongbao Auctions on May 15th, 2005 for US\$172,705, RMB1,430,000 (exchange rate 8.28). Like the subject property it depicts a standing deity and has a single line inscription stating that it is modeled after Tang period mural.


April 25th, 2004 a painting depicting a standing Guanyin after and a single line inscription also stating that it was modeled after a mural at the Mogao caves and signed and with two seals of the artist sold through Christies Hong Kong for \$\$US151,763A larger more elaborately rendered painting of Guanyin seated on a lotus with a long inscription by the artist at the top of the picture through Sotheby’s Hong Kong on May 1st, 2005 for \$489,231. It is dated to 1944 signed and has three seals of the artist.

Of these three paintings, the subject property is most similar to the Figure of Bodhisattva which sold for \$US172,705 on May 15th, 2005 and is the basis for the Fair Market Conclusion of the subject property.

\end{longtable}\paragraph{Description:}
A landscape rendered in ink washes and blue and green colors in an archaic style reminiscent of Tang Dynasty painting. The mounted hunters are rendered in the middle ground on a green spit of land. Behind them is a winding river, and autumnal trees dot the mountain-scape in the far distance. Three inscriptions by the artist are placed in the sky above the mountains.\paragraph{Market Analysis:}
According to Mr. Chang, the subject property is an extremely fine work and very desirable to mainland Chinese collectors who are particularly fond of Zhang Daqian’s early work. The painting demonstrates the artist’s range as it includes figures, horses, and landscape elements. One of the best of its type. Moreover, it is inscribed twice by the artist and includes two signatures and three seals. Finally, it has a very good provenance since it has been in the family’s possession since Choi Hac-ting received it from the artist in the late 40s to early 50s. (In 2013, the subject property sold through Beijing Poly International for \$6.9 million which is the 14th highest price ever paid for a painting by Zhang Daqian.) This is a rare and unique work which would have attracted much attention at auction in 2008.


A search of auction records in the years leading up to September 10th, 2008 yielded three similar size, style and era paintings, “Trading Geese” (figure B) which sold through China Guardian on November 5, 2007 for US\$345,772 and “Jinbi Landscape” \makexeCJKactive{}金璧山水\makexeCJKinactive{} (Figure C) which sold through Tianjin Wenwu for \$398,550 on November 16th 2004. And “Six Sages Gathering in a Bamboo Grove” (Figure D) which sold through Beijing Poly on November 7th, 2005 for \$816,844. It is inscribed and signed by the artist and has four seals. Like the subject property, all of these paintings demonstrate the artist’s range and include well rendered figures in an archaic style landscape. They date from the late 1930s to the late 1940s and are inscribed by the artist and include his signature and seals. The superb rendering of the figures in a bamboo grove next to a rushing stream in the “Six Sages of the Bamboo Grove” is closest in quality and rarity to the subject property. Although the subject property is closest in style and subject matter to the “Jinbi Landscape” and “Trading Geese”. The former emphasizes the landscape while the latter emphasize the figure. The subject matter of the subject property depicting two mounted hunters in an archaic Tang style landscape successfully merges both figures and landscape demonstrating, as Arnold Chang has noted the painters range. Moreover, the extensive inscriptions, multiple signatures and seals by the artist add to its rarity and desirability. The “Six Sages of the Bamboo Grove” is also a very rare work; the rendering of figures and landscape elements also demonstrates the artist’s range. Moreover, the multiple seals and inscription add to its value. In terms of rarity and execution, the subject property best approximates this painting which is the basis of the Fair Market conclusion of \$817,844.
