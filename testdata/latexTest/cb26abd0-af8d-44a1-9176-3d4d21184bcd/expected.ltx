\end{longtable}Dear Confidential:

According to the contract signed by you on February 12, 2013, we have prepared the following Self-Contained appraisal report for the property represented as belonging to the Confidential. The subject property consists of a collection of contemporary art. This property will be donated to the Confidential on or about April 13, 2013. According the Confidential, the recipient is a qualified charitable organization and the property is relevant to its charitable purpose. In addition, the donee stated that there are no restrictions on the donation.


You provided us with the information that indicates that the subject properties are owned by Confidential. We examined the properties in the presence of Confidential at Confidential


This appraisal report provides the appraisal conclusion of Fair Market Value for the intended use of Charitable Donation for Income Tax.(Unexpected XTag: NTree (XTag "br" []) [])Fair Market Value is defined as “the price at which the property would sell for on the open market. It is the price that would be agreed on between a willing buyer and a willing seller, with neither being required to act, and both having reasonable knowledge of the relevant facts.” (from Internal Revenue Service, Department of Treasury Publication 561: Determining the Value of Donated Property (Revised April, 2007). In addition, as defined by IRS Estate Tax Regulation §20.2031-(b), fair market value for tax purposes must be based on the sale price “in which such item is most commonly sold to the public...”. In this case, depending on the artist, the work and their market, the “most common market” has been determined to be either the auction market at regional, national and international auction houses, the publisher, or in a few cases, the artist’s studio.


This report will function as documented evidence of these appraisers having witnessed the subject properties, and identified, described and valued the subject properties in the context of estimating Fair Market Value.


After thorough consideration of available facts and statistics, April 13th, 2013, the Fair Market Value for the subject properties is \textbf{one million two hundred thirty four thousand five hundred nine dollars (\$1,234,509)}. The effective date of value for this appraisal is April 13th, 2013. This professional opinion is based upon our knowledge and experience in the valuation of fine arts. This appraisal is based on our research and analysis of the properties and knowledge of relevant markets where the properties are traded.


This is a Self-Contained report that was prepared to conform to the Code of Ethics of the American Society of Appraisers and the current version of the \emph{Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice, the 2012-2013 Edition} (USPAP), published by the Appraisal Foundation. We have no past, present or contemplated future interest in the properties included in this report. Our fee was not contingent on any value finding.


We are “qualified appraisers’’ within the meaning of Internal Revenue Reg. 1.170A-17(b) and are not excluded appraisers within the meaning of 1.170A-17(b)(5). Lydia Thompson is designated as an Accredited Senior Appraiser of Personal Property from the American Society of Appraisers. Natasha Martinez holds the Candidate designation from the American Society of Appraisers. Our background, education and experience qualify us to make appraisals of the type of property that is the subject of this appraisal. A complete list of our qualifications can be found in our Credentials which are included in this report. We understand that the appraisal will be used in connection with a tax return or claim for refund. We also understand that, if a substantial or gross valuation misstatement of the value of the property claimed on the return or claim for refund results from our appraisal, we may be subject to a penalty under section 6695A of the Internal Revenue Code, as well as other applicable penalties. We affirm that we have not been barred from presenting evidence of testimony before the Department of the Treasury or the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to 31 U.S.C. section 330(c).


This \pageref{LastPage} page report is bound in two volumes. Volume 1 consists of a letter of transmittal, scope of work, definitions, privacy statement, assumptions and limiting conditions, certification, description, photographs, narrative, glossary, bibliography and credentials, along with Items 1 to 57. Volume 2 includes Items 58 to 136, and Appendices A and B. All these elements must be present for the value conclusion to be valid.


The information in this report is confidential. All notes, electronic, work copies and photographs remain the property of the appraisers and are retained for five years, and/or two years after the conclusion of any litigation. All documents are shredded or otherwise defaced prior to disposal.


The submission of this report completes our assignment and obligations. Any further consultation, preparation of additional reports, testimony, or appearances in court or before any governmental forum in reference to the properties described in this appraisal will require additional fees to cover the required services. The aforementioned fees will be billed at the rate commensurate with the timing of the appraisal.


Thank you for allowing us to be of service to you.

\authorsignature\newpage{}\newpage{}\section{Scope of Work}
Thompson \& Martinez Fine Art Appraisals, Inc. was hired by Confidential to reach an opinion of the Fair Market Value of a collection of contemporary art, for the intended use of Charitable Donation for Income Tax. This property, acquired by Confidential, is to be donated to the Confidential Foundation on or about April 13th, 2013. Based on our discussion with Confidential as well as the intended use of the report, the type and location of the subject properties and the effective date of valuation, the appraisers have selected the type of value, the relevant market, the information researched and the analysis to be applied. As defined by IRS Estate Tax Regulation §20.2031-(b), fair market value for tax purposes must be based on the sale price “in which such item is most commonly sold to the public...” In this case, depending on the artist, the work and their market, the “most common market” has been determined to be either the auction market at regional, national and international auction houses, the publisher or gallery, or in a few cases, the artist’s studio. To complete this assignment we consulted authoritative publications and on-line sources, reviewed published and on-line market data and interviewed the artists, knowledgeable dealers and others regarding the artists and their works.


The properties were inspected from February 11th-13th at the Confidential. The items are organized in the report in accordance with the inventory provided by the client’s representative. This report is intended to be an objective, independent, unbiased and credible analysis of known facts. During the course of our examination, research and analysis, we have endeavored to be accurate and to use due diligence. This opinion of value was developed using appraisal methods that are within the accepted standard of care for the appraisal profession and within the boundaries of typical practice.


This appraisal document reports the majority of information analyzed, the appraisal procedures followed, and the reasoning that supports the analysis, opinions and conclusions under the requirements of the \emph{Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice, the 2012-2013 Edition} (USPAP). It is considered a Self-Contained appraisal report. The documentation substantiating the value reported is held in the Appraiser’s file.

\newpage{}\section{Type of Value}
This report serves as documented evidence of this appraiser having witnessed the subject property and identified, described and valued the subject property in the context of determining Fair Market Value. \section{Intended Use}
The intended use of this report, as stipulated, is to evaluate the subject properties and provide an assessment of Fair Market Value of a collection of contemporary art for the intended use of Charitable Donation. No other use is valid or condoned.\section{Intended Users of this report}
The intended users of this report are: Confidential, its fiscal agents, financial representatives and attorneys. There are no other intended users or uses.\section{Definition of Value}
Fair Market Value is defined as “the price at which the property would sell for on the open market. It is the price that would be agreed on between a willing buyer and a willing seller, with neither being required to act, and both having reasonable knowledge of the relevant facts.” (from Internal Revenue Service, Department of Treasury Publication 561: Determining the Value of Donated Property (Revised April, 2007). In addition, as defined by IRS Estate Tax Regulation §20.2031-(b), fair market value for tax purposes must be based on the sale price “in which such item is most commonly sold to the public...”. In this case, depending on the artist, the work and their market, the “most common market” has been determined to be either the auction market at regional, national and international auction houses, the publisher, or in a few cases, the artist’s studio.\section{Approaches to Value}
For this appraisal three valuation methods were considered (from Soucy and Smith, eds, \emph{The Appraisal of Personal Property – Principles, Theories, and Practice Methods for the Professional Appraiser}, 1994.). The three valuation methods are:\begin{compactitem}\item[$\bullet$]\textbf{Cost Approach to Value} method estimates either the reproduction or replacement of a property, either new or depreciated.\item[$\bullet$]\textbf{Income Approach to Value} method estimates the present worth of anticipated future benefits of owning income producing properties or objects.\item[$\bullet$]\textbf{Market Comparison Approach to Value} method estimates value by comparison with properties sold in the relevant market with adjustments for all differences that affect value, such as differences in characteristics of value, in market layer, and in time exposed to the market in order to arrive at the most apposite estimate of value.\end{compactitem}The Market Comparison Approach was chosen for this assignment. The Cost and Income Approaches to value were considered but not appropriate to this assignment. Although the Cost Approach would be able to replicate the subject property in form, it would not represent the age, history and desirability of a collection of contemporary art. The Income Approach also was not appropriate because an income cannot be derived from this property. Therefore the value conclusion of this report is based on market data and comparable sales, taking into consideration the differences that affect value cited above. Market data includes auction records, retail and private sales, dealer’s inventories and catalogs. The appraiser relied on contacts with other professionals in this field. Sources are listed at the end of the report.\newpage{}\section{Privacy Policy}

\begin{description}\item[Aquatint] A print made by an etching technique characterized by the control of tonal areas to produce an unlimited series of gradations from pale grey to velvety black and a pleasing granular effect. The term derives from the resemblance of these prints to drawings done with watercolor washes (Mayer, p. 18).
\item[Chine Colle] A process developed in the 19th century which enabled artists to print on delicate papers imported from China. This paper (“Chine”) was attached (“collé”) to a heavier paper support as it passed through the etching press. This process gave the artist access to greater variety in their etchings; they could add color to the print by choosing a thin paper in a shade that differed from the backing sheet (http://www.ifpda.org/content/collecting\_{}prints/glossary\#chine-coll–).
\item[Etching] A print made by an intaglio printing process where a drawing is made with a steel etching needle onto a highly polished metal plate covered with a thin coat of acid resistant etching ground, which is then dipped into an acid bath or mordant to engrave the plate (Mayer, p. 143).
\item[Granolithograph] A print made by a proprietary photomechanical reproductive process.
\item[Impression] Any numbered print from a completed edition.
\item[Intaglio] One of the three main graphic arts processes in which printing areas are recessed, including etching, engraving, drypoint, aquatint and photogravure (Mayer, p. 205).
\item[Lithograph] A print made by a planographic printing process in which prints are pulled on a special press from a flat surface sensitized by chemical means so that the ink takes on the design areas only and is repelled by the blank areas (Mayer, p. 243).
\item[Mezzotint] Mezzotints are best known for their rich and luscious black tones and soft, subtle areas of light. The resulting image appears hazy and atmospheric, almost like a photograph. Unlike the other intaglio processes, this technique is worked from dark to light; the entire surface of the plate is abraded using a spiked tool called a rocker. These grooves will hold the printing ink and if inked at this point in the process, the plate would print entirely black. To create variations in tone, the artist scrapes and burnishes the abraded plate to smooth out the surface so that those areas will hold less ink and thus yield lighter tones in the image (http://www.ifpda.org/content/collecting\_{}prints/glossary).
\item[Monotype] A single print made by painting onto glass or metal and then transferring the image onto a piece of paper pressed over it. (Cumming, p. 490).
\item[Photogravure] A print created by the most important commercial intaglio printing process, noted for its high quality reproduction of halftones and color artwork. The original to be reproduced is photographed through a finely cross-ruled screen onto a sensitized copper plate, breaking up the photographic image into cells of even size. The inking and printing processes are those used for printing an etching (Mayer, p. 310).
\item[Planographic] One of the three main graphic arts categories, where the prints are pulled from a flat surface (Mayer, p. 315).
\item[Screenprint] Also known as a serigraph or silkscreen print. A print made by a color stencil printing process in which the coloring matter is forced with a squeegee through a fine screen, in which non printing areas have been blocked out, onto the printing surface below (Mayer, p. 381).
\item[Woodcut] One of the most basic printing techniques, whereby the design to be printed is cut into a block of wood. (Cumming, p. 501).

\begin{description}\item[Excellent:] The object's stability and state of preservation (i.e. wear and/or losses to paper, decoration, pigment, chips etc.) exhibits stable condition or integrity; function or artistic intent is structurally sound; no restoration material added and no significant repairs.
\item[Very Good:] State of preservation is near original condition; object exhibits stabilization/conservation possibly reflecting slight deterioration from original function or artistic intent.  Structural integrity is maintained.  Some repairs are evident and unobtrusive; no restoration, i.e. all original material.
\item[Good:] State of preservation exhibits clearly its original function and artistic intent, however, the object shows considerable wear.  Stabilization, conservation, restoration reflect original function and maintain artistic intent and structural integrity.  Restoration and repairs are evident; i.e. there may be added material; or, repairs may be needed.
\item[Fair:] State of preservation shows considerable wear and deterioration yet still indicates the general nature of its original form; the object may need structural stabilization, conservation, restoration and/or repairs.
\item[Poor:] State of preservation indicates substantial deterioration compromising original form; the object needs structural stabilization, conservation, restoration and/or repairs.

The global market for fine art in 2012 and early 2013 continues to recover, reflecting the trajectory of the economy and financial markets. In fact, according to Artprice, 2012 sales rose to \$7.2 billion in Western countries, some 5.5\% higher than in 2011. This trend reflects continuing diversification and growth in the number of buyers, as well as the volume of artworks sold. Modern and contemporary art dominated in market share, with 20th century artists dominating the upper end of the market. Although confidence has returned to the very top-end of the market, since the downturn in 2008, recovery at the low and mid-level markets has been more inconsistent, depending in part on whether the artist has a regional, national or global market. In many cases, prices remain depressed or flat for works by artists who have a regional and national market presence while the prices for works by artists with a global market have been generally more robust.

In the current market, quality, reputation and rarity are key elements of value.  The fame or recognition an artist receives is due in part to the quality and uniqueness of the work, but also in part to interest by significant stakeholders in the market, whether by museums and academics, who through the mechanism of exhibition and publication, draw collector attention and interest to an artist's work, or by dealers who cultivate collector interest through gallery showings.

The Confidential collection includes 136 works of art in various media including, prints, works on paper, photographs, and sculpture. Most of the works are by internationally-known, mid to late career artists, some of whom have passed away since their work was acquired, including among others, Robert Rauschenberg, John Baldessari, Frank Stella, Ross Bleckner, Alex Katz, Sol LeWitt, Robert Mangold, Elizabeth Murray, Olafur Eliasson, Ellsworth Kelly, Uta Barth, Richard Long, Jorge Pardo, Ed Ruscha and Elyn Zimmerman. Also in the collection are prints by Andy Warhol (1928-1993), and Saul Steinberg (1914-1999). A few works are by young or emerging artists, such as  Ryan Spencer (b.\textbackslash{}1976), a young photographer who is not currently working as a professional artist. 

Most of the works date from the mid-90s through 2005, and were acquired in original condition, "new," directly from the artists, galleries and publishers. The majority of prints and photographs are in very good to excellent condition since they were framed with high quality, archival materials. The only works in fair condition are two mounted prints by Ray Charles White which were not framed and displayed in high-traffic areas of the facility. 

Due to their recent creation dates, the majority of works in this collection are still in the first ownership cycle. In the case of editioned works, many are still in the current inventories of their publishers and have not yet been sold in the secondary market.  Consequently, for many of the works in this collection the most common market is through the artist's studio, gallery or publisher.  According to Confidential, Confidential institution received 10-15\% discount for most works in the collection, which is a customary discount for collectors of fine art prints through galleries and publishers. Based on this discounting practice for collectors, a 10\% discount is applied to the published prices of works currently offered through print publishers and at galleries. The monumental glass chandelier by Dale Chihuly was commissioned from the studio as a site-specific piece for Confidential institution. 
 
According to Blouin ArtInfo, an online magazine ("Everything You Need to Know About the Booming Market for Prints," 10/22/12),  the fine art print market has become increasingly attractive to collectors looking for opportunities to acquire works by well known artists for a fraction of the price of unique works in other media. Fine art prints sales are typically not as volatile as other market segments, but rather have generally increased moderately over time. Over the past fifty years, master print studios such as Gemini G.E.L. on Los Angeles, Crown Point Press in San Francisco, Universal Limited Art Editions in New York and others have emerged as key sources for fine art prints in their role as publishers of such prints for Pop and Minimalist artists, as well as for younger Conceptual and contemporary artists. Some of these studios or publishers are associated with brick and mortar gallery spaces, while others sell works primarily online. Value characteristics for prints typically include size, edition size, impression quality and condition, as well as subject. In some cases, depending on the policy of the print studio or publisher, a key characteristic of value for limited edition prints is the number of impressions remaining in the edition. As the print run reaches the end, the price increases. In researching the prints in the  collection the Appraisers asked publishers for information regarding the number of prints remaining in numbered editions, as well as their policies regarding pricing. Some publishers were forthcoming, others were not. Since the formation of the collection in 2005, the editions of several of the subject works have sold out or have nearly sold out, including screenprints by Robert Rauschenberg, the suite entitled "Intervals" by Terry Winters, the three-dimensional lithograph by Elizabeth Murray, "Sea State V" by Matthew Ritchie and the two acquatints from \_{}From the Boat\_{} series by Pat Steir. These factors have been considered, as known and as appropriate, in the market analyses and value conclusions for the works in this appraisal.


\newpage{}\#\#Suzanne Anker

\#\#\#\#Biography
Suzanne Anker is an American visual artist and theorist known for her work in the genre of "Sci-Art." Anker's work focuses on the use of genetic imagery and examines the intersection of art and science. Her work has been exhibited at the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C., Getty Institution, Los Angeles, and Museum of Modern Art, Japan, among others. She is currently Chair of the Art Department at the School of Visual Arts in New York.

\#\#\#\#Market Analysis
The subject properties are four individual prints in excellent condition that explore genetic imagery. A survey of auction sales located only a few sales of her work for nominal prices, indicating that it is not the most common market for this artist. Anker sells her work primarily from her studio, and several titled portfolios of her work are illustrated on her website, including installations, prints and works on paper. According to the artist, impressions from the same editions as the subject properties are still available  for purchase and are priced at \$2,000. She declined to disclose whether there had been any recent sales for these works, or for her works from other series. The NVCI's collection's curator, Michele Quinn, provided information that the prints were purchased for \$1,500 in 2005. Anker's current studio price reflects a moderate increase since the original sale of the works, and appears consistent with the artist's level of professional recognition as reflected in her position as Chair of the School of Visual Arts Art Department and her exhibition history at significant American museums. Therefore the current studio price is the basis for the Fair Market Value conclusion of \$2,000 for each print.\newpage{}\begin{tabular*}{\textwidth}{l@{\extracolsep{\fill}}@{\extracolsep{0pt}}@{\extracolsep{\fill}}r}

Jo Baer is a painter and printmaker known for her reductive, hard-edged style and minimalist compositions. Largely self-taught as an artist, Baer has exhibited at important venues such as the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, and Modern Art Oxford.


The subject property is a suite of nine screenprints in excellent condition. A survey of auction sales located several offerings of a portion–typically four or five prints–of the series, ranging from \$1,725 to \$3,125, and none for the complete suite of nine prints. The most recent auction offerings were bought in. According to Barbara Baruch at the Brooke Alexander Gallery, which published the suite, the edition is almost sold out, and only an artist proof remains, which is offered for \$10,000. There was no difference in the asking price for numbered editions. Since its publication therefore, the publisher can be considered the most common market for this work. A 10\% collector’s discount, customary for print publishers and galleries, was applied and results in a Fair Market Value conclusion of \$9,000.

\$9,000.00\newpage{}\#\#John Baldessari

\#\#\#\#Biography
John Baldessari is a Conceptual artist based in Southern California who works in a variety of media including photography, painting and sculpture. Baldessari is especially known for the use of found media and pop culture imagery in his art. He has had more than 120 solo shows and participated in more than 300 group exhibitions in the Unites States and Europe.

\#\#\#\#Market Overview
Baldessari has a diverse market and sells at both auction and retail. He has a robust presence in the auction market, with numerous sales in the past ten years. Baldessari's print and multiples sales since 2008 at auction range from \$1,000 to \$458,500. Value characteristics for Baldessari's works may include size, edition size, medium and subject. The subject properties include a variety of media including screenprints, lithographs, and photogravures. All but one of the subject properties are still in publisher inventory and this is therefore the most common market for these works. The edition of one of the works has sold out, and in that case comparables at the auction level were sought as the most appropriate common market for that work.

The subject property is a print in excellent condition. According to the Sabine Ofenback at Texte zur Kunst, the edition is sold out. The final published price was approximately \$350.00. The publisher stated that the date it sold out could not be confirmed as no records of the sales were retained. The auction market has been determined to be the most common market for this work and a survey of auction sales located three sales of this particular work. Although the specific condition of the comparables could not be determined, there is no indication that any was in anything less than good condition. The Fair Market Value conclusion of \$1,286 is based on the most recent sale, which is closest to the subject property in impression quality based on its number in the edition.

Burt Barr is an American videographer who also produces single and multiple panel large scale still images that explore the temporal and rhythmic aspects of his non-narrative and non-character based imagery. Barr’s work has been exhibited worldwide, including at the National Gallery, Washington D.C., and Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, in the United States and at the Reina Sofia Museum in Madrid.


The subject property is a suite of five three panel prints in excellent condition. A survey of auction records did not locate any auction sales for this artist, indicating that his most common market is at the retail level. This print suite is in the current inventory of Graphic Studio, where one to two full suites are still available, as well as additional copies of some of the individual panels. According to Kristin Soderqvist, each panel may be purchased separately for \$3,000, or all five may be purchased for a discounted price of \$12,500. The latter is the basis of the Fair Market Value conclusion of \$12,500.

\$12,500.00\newpage{}\#\#Uta Barth

\#\#\#\#Biography
Uta Barth is a German born artist now living in the United States. Barth is known for conceptual photography, which has as its intent the goal of focusing on visual perception rather than on a particular subject. Barth's work has been featured in numerous one person and group exhibitions in the United States and Europe, including the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. She received a Guggenheim fellowship in 2004, and teaches at the University of California, Riverside.

\#\#\#\#Market Analysis
The subject properties are two photographic works in excellent condition. Barth's work is sold at the Tanya Bonakdar Gallery in New York and at auction. Despite repeated contacts by email and telephone, the gallery declined to disclose any information on the artists sales or market. In the case of the subject properties, item number 12 is still available from its publisher, and therefore its most common market is the publisher.  Item number 13 was produced by the artist in a small edition, and originally sold at retail. As current retail data could not be obtained from her gallery representation, a survey of auction sales located several sales of  Barth's photographs, and the most similar comparables are the basis of the Fair Market Value conclusion for the latter work.\newpage{}\begin{tabular*}{\textwidth}{l@{\extracolsep{\fill}}@{\extracolsep{0pt}}@{\extracolsep{\fill}}r}

See the general Biography and Market Analysis statement at the beginning of this section.


The subject property is a color photograph dyptich in excellent condition from a relatively larger edition for Barth’s work, which often features smaller editions of under ten works. Barth’s dyptich compositions from small editions sell from \$5,490 to \$8,750 at auction. The subject property, however, is a work from a large edition still offered in inventory at Editions Schellmann, and this is therefore the most common market for this work. The current published price for the dyptich is \$2,400. A 10\% collector’s discount, customary for print publishers and galleries, was applied and results in a Fair Market Value conclusion of \$2,160.

See the general Biography and Market Analysis statement at the beginning of this section.


The subject property is a set of four photographs from a small edition in excellent condition. A survey of auction sales since 2008 indicates that the median sales price for Barth’s single panel works is \$5,000 and for diptychs is \$5,625. There have been only four offerings of Barth’s four and five panel photographic compositions, with two bought in; a 2010 sale for a very similar four panel work for \$6,600 that sold slightly below its estimate, and a 2008 sale for a slightly later five panel composition with a distinctly different subject, in that case a floral still life, that realized \$23,594, substantially over the estimate. Although the condition of the comparables cannot be determined precisely they appear to be in good condition and no deficiencies are noted. The sale closest to the subject property in subject, size and date–which also is the most recent–is the basis for the Fair Market Value conclusion of \$6,600.

An abstract horizontal composition of vertical saturated color stripes with two large bands of kelly green on each side and smaller bands of bright and pastel shades of red, yellow, purple, orange and blue in the center.\paragraph{Market Analysis:}
Tim Bavington is a British artist now living and working in Las Vegas. He trained at the Art Center College of Art and Design in Pasadena and holds an MFA from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Bavington is known for his explorations of color and its relationship to musical scales. He has been exhibiting and selling his work since the mid 1990s. Bavington has had several exhibitions at galleries in the Untied States and Europe.


The subject property is a large painting in excellent condition. A survey of auction sales located only a few sales for this artist, indicating that this is not the most common market for this artist, although there was a sale for a slightly larger work, 34 inches x 85 inches, quite similar to the subject property, “Wayward no. 1,” 2005 which sold at Phillips de Pury for \$13,750 on 3/8/12 (lot \#173). Bavington is represented by the Mark Moore Gallery in Culver City, California, which has several similar works in inventory, indicating that the retail market is the most common market for this artist. For example, a slightly smaller polymer on canvas painting, “Thick as a Brick,” 2012, 48 inches x 24 inches, is offered for \$11,500. A slightly larger work, Lazy Gun (Ruff B) (Pink Study)," 2005, 16 inches x 64 inches, is offered for \$18,000 (see Figure 2). Marielos Zeka of Mark Moore states that the subject property would be offered for \$14,000 today. This is consistent with pricing for Bavington’s other works. Applying a 10\% discount customarily offered to collectors results in a Fair Market Value conclusion of \$12,400.

\paragraph{Fair Market Value: }
\$12,400.00\newpage{}\#\#Ross Bleckner

\#\#\#\#Biography
Ross Bleckner is an American artist who works in both representational and abstract modes, often examining microscopic and biomorphic life forms. Bleckner's work has been exhibited internationally and he was the subject of a major retrospective at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York in 1995. Trained in New York and California, Bleckner has also taught at several universities in the United States.

\#\#\#\#Market Overview
The subject properties are etchings and aquatints in excellent condition. Bleckner's work is sold at both the retail and auction levels. A search of auction databases for prints by Ross Bleckner yielded results for some of the same aquatint etchings as the subject property in this appraisal. A couple were recent sales and ranged from \$1,000 to \$1,875.  All of these prints were published by Paulson Bott Press, and with the exception of one, "Leader Sequence," are in current inventory. Therefore, the publisher is the most common market for these prints and value conclusions are based on current prices. Since it is sold out at the retail level, the auction market was determined to be the appropriate market level for "Leader Sequence" and the value conclusion is based on the analysis of auction sales comparables.\newpage{}\begin{tabular*}{\textwidth}{l@{\extracolsep{\fill}}@{\extracolsep{0pt}}@{\extracolsep{\fill}}r}

The subject property is a print in excellent condition that has completely sold out its edition at Paulson Bott Press. Its final published price was \$4,000. As the print can no longer be purchased through the publisher, the auction market has now become its most common market as this is the market level where it is now, or now would be, bought and sold. A survey of auction sales located numerous print sales for this artist but none for this specific work. Bleckner works in a variety of print media including etchings, lithographs and screenprints. Since 2009, Bleckners’s screenprints and lithographs have sold from \$122 to \$6,600, with most sales in the \$1,000 to \$2,000 range. There have been only two sales of etchings, both in 2011, and these two sales are the most comparable to the subject property in subject and date, although they are slightly smaller in size. Although the condition of the comparables could not be specifically determined, there is no indication that is was less than good. These sales, averaged, are the basis for the Fair Market Value conclusion of \$1,032.

Figurative desert night scape with silhoueted trees and shooting stars against a deep blue sky.\paragraph{Market Analysis:}
Richard Bosman is an Australian artist now living in the US. Trained in England and the US, Bosman is known for his figurative-expressionist approach, which often utilizes a single frame stop-action technique familiar from films and comic strips. Bosman’s work has been exhibited internationally and in the US, including at the Toledo Museum of Art and the Fort Worth Art Museum in Texas.


The subject property is an excellent work by the artist, and is in excellent condition. Bosman’s work sells at both the retail and auction level. A survey of auction sales did not locate any sales of this particular print, but did locate sales of other nightscape compositions ranging from ? to \$1,200. The subject property is in the inventory of its publisher, Brooke Alexander, and this is therefore its most common market. The published price is \$3,500. A 10\% collector’s discount, customary for print publishers and galleries, was applied and results in a Fair Market Value conclusion of \$3,150.

Mark Brandvik is a Las Vegas based artist with primarily regional recognition. He works in a variety of media, including painting, drawing and sculpture. Brandvik holds an MFA from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. He has exhibited his work primarily in Nevada, and is represented in a small number of private and corporate collections there, including the Cirque de Soleil collection.


The subject property is a painting executed in enamel on board in excellent condition. The artist is not represented by any gallery at this time and sells his work to collectors directly from his studio. A survey of auction sales did not locate any sales for this artist. According to Brandvik, the subject property, a painting on panel from his \emph{place} series, is a type of work he is no longer producing. Branvik is currently focusing on large sculptural work. The artist states that he recently sold another work from the \emph{places} series, an automotive primer on panel painting similar to the subject property, “Joe Williams,” 2007, 24 inches x 48 inches (see Figure 2), to the Cirque de Soleil collection for \$3,300. Both paintings are similar in quality, subject, size and date. He also stated that a smaller similar work, “Davy’s Locker,” 18 inches x 24 inches, about half the size of the subject property, was recently consigned by Michele Quinn in a private sale for \$1,500. The Cirque de Soleil sale is most similar to the subject property and is the basis of the Fair Market Value conclusion of \$3,300.

\end{longtable}\paragraph{Description:}
A suite of five abstract geometric compositions on pastel backgrounds.\paragraph{Market Analysis:}
Suzanne Caporael is an American painter whose imagery, ranging from refined figuration to color-field abstraction, derives from her persistent observation of the natural world and strong interest in visual perception. Carporael earned her Bachelor and Master of Arts at the Otis Art Institute, Los Angeles. In 2009, Caporael was a guest artist-in-residence at the Josef and Anni Albers Foundation. Her work is represented in museum collections, including the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, Art Institute of Chicago, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.


The subject property is a suite of prints in excellent condition. Suzanne Caporael is represented by Ameringer, McEnery, and Yohe Gallery in New York. According to Miles McEnery, the gallery does not sell the artist’s prints as they are sold directly by the publisher. The suite is sold out at its publisher, Tandem Press, where it was last sold for \$4,000. A search of sales records of auction listings dating back to 2008 yielded only two sales of color lithographs produced by the artist, ranging in price from \$400 to \$2,750. The majority of Caporael’s sales at auction are for her small oils and gouache works, with the highest sale in 2003 for a larger oil painting, 48 inches x 36 inches, that sold for \$10,800 at Sotheby’s (11/17/03, lot \#76), indicating that there is a limited secondary market for her prints. Most recently, an untitled lithograph produced by the artist in 1989 was sold through Susanin’s on March 27, 2010 for \$400. This work is dated earlier than the subject property and is quite different in style. “Hardangerfjord”, 2004, a color lithograph, 48 inches x 37.5 inches, also published by Tandem Press, was sold through Christie’s for \$2,750 (7/31/08, lot \#194). It is most similar in style and composition to the individual works that comprise the suite of 5 color lithographs in the Nevada Cancer Institute collection, but is twice the size. The Fair Market Value conclusion of \$6,875 is based on a 50\% discount for the smaller size of the prints in the subject property, and multiplied by five for the number of prints in the set.

See the general Biography and Market Analysis statement at the beginning of this section.


The subject properties are a suite of five prints featuring abstract compositions typical for the artist. The prints are in the current inventory of their publisher, Pace Prints, and therefore this is their most common market. The published price is \$10,000. A 10\% collector’s discount, customary for print publishers and galleries, was applied and results in a Fair Market Value conclusion of \$9,000.

\end{longtable}\paragraph{Description:}
A dyptich featuring a double color aerial image of an Icelandic volcanic landscape, with areas of snow, bare rock and tundra.\paragraph{Market Analysis:}
Olafur Eliasson is a Danish artist who now lives and works in Germany. Trained in Denmark, Eliasson is known for his gallery and museum installations that recreate natural phenomena, as well as for his photographs documenting how the natural world is formed, particularly in Iceland. Eliasson exhibits his work internationally.


The subject property depicts the Icelandic landscape. It is an excellent example of the artist’s work in excellent condition. A survey of auction records located two offerings of prints from this edition, both offered for sale in 2010. One did not result in a sale and was estimated at \$3,353 (2,500 euros), and the second offering sold for \$3,075. Published by Editions Schellmann, the subject property is still available through the publisher though the gallery would not confirm the number remaining in the edition. Therefore the publisher is the most common market for the subject property and therefore the published price of(Unexpected XTag: NTree (XTag "br" []) [])\$7,500 with the customary 10\% collector’s discount is the basis of the Fair Market Value conclusion of \$6,750.

\end{longtable}\paragraph{Description:}
Suite of four prints with abstract rectangular compositions in tones of black and grey on a yellow field.\paragraph{Market Analysis:}
Günther Forg is a prominent German artist who now lives and works in Switzerland. Forg, who works in a variety of media including painting, drawing, photography, sculpture and printmaking, was trained in Germany. He is known for exploring a wide breadth of styles and ideas in his work, along with minimalist and expressionist influences. Forg’s work is exhibited worldwide, including at the Musee de Art Moderne de la Ville in Paris, Tel Aviv Museum of Art, Israel, and Institut Valencia d’Art Modern, Valencia, Spain.


The subject property is a suite of lithographs in excellent condition. According to Galerie Grasslin the edition is sold out, and if a consigned impression were offered it would be priced at \$4,000. Given this finding the auction level is the most common market for these prints. A survey of auction sales since 2008 located sales of individual prints including lithographs, etchings, screenprints and woodcuts, ranging in price from \$295 to \$739, and sets of multiple prints ranging from \$732 to \$11,270. There was no consistent pattern in the auction sales reflecting higher sales price for suites with six as opposed to three or four prints. The median sale for a set of prints was \$3,267 for a set of six lithographs, “Untitled,” 1990 (Lempertz, 12/5/09, lot \#407; see example, Figure 5). This sale is the most similar in date, size and style to the color lithographs in the Nevada Cancer Institute collection and is, therefore, the basis of the Fair Market Value conclusion of \$3,267.

His work is in the collections of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, Massachusetts, Brooklyn Museum of Art, New York, Denver Museum of Art, Colorado, and Whitney Museum of American Art, New York. 

\#\#\#\#Market Analysis
The subject properties are two prints in excellent condition. A search of auction records did not locate any sales for this artist. However, a search of the retail market indicates that prints are still in the inventory of their publisher, the Leroy Neiman Print Study Center at Columbia University in New York. Therefore the publisher is the most common market. The published price is \$3,500. A 10\% collector's discount, customary for print publishers and galleries, was applied and results in a Fair Market Value conclusion of \$3,150 for each print.\newpage{}\begin{tabular*}{\textwidth}{l@{\extracolsep{\fill}}@{\extracolsep{0pt}}@{\extracolsep{\fill}}r}

Mary Heilman is an American painter, ceramicist and furniture designer, known for imbuing her work with recollections, stories from her imagination, and references to music. Her compositions are often rendered in two- and three-dimensions, joining several canvases into new works, or creating diptychs of paintings and photographs in the form of prints, slideshows, and videos. Heilman received her BA at University of California at Santa Barbara, continued her education at San Francisco State University, and received her MA at the University of California at Berkeley. Heilmann’s work has appeared in three Whitney Biennial exhibitions (1972, 1989, 2008) and is in collections, including the Museum of Modern Art, New York, Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, and Orange County Museum of Art, California.


The subject properties are a suite of three prints in excellent condition that represent good example of the artist’s work. Heilman’s prints sell at retail and at auction. The subject suite is still in the inventory of its publisher, Pace Prints, and this is therefore its most common market. The published price is \$4,000. A 10\% collector’s discount, customary for print publishers and galleries, was applied and results in a Fair Market Value conclusion of \$3,600.

Suite of five prints with abstract patterned design in aqua on cream colored paper.\paragraph{Market Analysis:}
Arturo Herrera is a Venezuelan artist now working in New York. Herrera is particularly known for his use of pop imagery, especially those drawn from Disney animation. He works in a variety of media including painting, drawing, prints, cut paper and felt pieces. Trained in the United States, Herrera has exhibited his work worldwide, including at United States venues such as P.S. 1, New York, Contemporary Art Center, New York, Art Pace, San Antonio, and Art Institute of Chicago.


The subject property is a suite of five prints in excellent condition. A survey of auction sales located several sales of works by this artist, but none of prints, indicating that the auction market is not the most common market for Herrera’s prints. Herrera’s work in other media have sold at auction in recent years from \$6,875 for a small mixed media collage (Phillips de Pury \& Co., 11/20/12, lot \#68) to \$218,500 for a large scale collage work, the latter greatly in excess of its estimate of \$40-60,000 (Sotheby’s, “Untitled (Double Castle/Purple),” 5/23/12, lot \#49). Therefore, the retail market was researched for the artist’s print sales. Herrera has three prints in current inventory at Pace Prints, but these are prints using collage and felt cut outs along with a variety of print techniques including etching, lithography and pochoir, and are so different as not to be comparable to the subject property. The subject suite of prints was originally published by Sikkema Jenkins Editions, which has become a part of Sikkema Jenkins \& Co. in New York. According to the the Meg Malloy at Sikkema Jenkins \& Co, which currently represents the artist, the edition for this print sold out in 2007 and at that time, the sale price was \$7,500. The Gallery is now offering a consigned set for \$15,000. This is the only offering of print works located for this artist. A 10\% collector’s discount, customary for print publishers and galleries, was applied and results in a Fair Market Value conclusion of \$13,500.

\#\#\#\#Biography
Salomon Huerta is a Mexican American artist known for his minimalist portraits of the backs of heads and richly colored depictions of urban scenes and architectural details. Huerta trained at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena and holds an MFA from the University of California, Los Angeles. Huerta exhibits his work nationally and in Europe, and currently is represented by the Patrick Painter Gallery in Santa Monica, California. 

\#\#\#\#\#Market Analysis
The subject properties are three prints in excellent condition from Huerta's house series. Huerta's work sells primarily at the gallery level, with only a few recorded auction sales. The subject properties are prints still in inventory of their publisher, Paulson Bott Press in Berkeley, California, and this is therefore their most common market. The published price is \$2,000 for each print. A 10\% collector's discount, customary for print publishers and galleries, was applied and results in a Fair Market Value conclusion of \$1,800 per print.\newpage{}\begin{tabular*}{\textwidth}{l@{\extracolsep{\fill}}@{\extracolsep{0pt}}@{\extracolsep{\fill}}r}

Set of three prints with abstract minimalist compositions with floral motifs.\paragraph{Market Analysis:}
Gary Hume is a British painter influenced by minimalism, decorative art, and abstraction. Hume graduated from Goldsmiths’ School of Art, London, and was part of the Young British Artists (YBA) movement in the early 1990s. His work focuses on form and color through a variety of media. Hume has participated in the Venice Biennale, and his work is included in public collections, such as the Art Institute of Chicago, Arts Council of Great Britain, Tate Gallery, London, Paine Webber Art Collection, New York, and the Bonnefanten Musuem, Maastricht.


The subject properties are a set of three prints in very good condition. Hume sells his work at retail and at auction. According to the publisher, Paragon Press, there is one remaining set of the prints available, and this is therefore their most common market. The published price is \$25,000. A 10\% collector’s discount, customary for print publishers and galleries, was applied and results in a Fair Market Value conclusion of \$22,500.

Shawn Hummel is a Las Vegas based artist who also is a graduate of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Hummel creates images of the Vegas scene, represented as lights and colors rather than realistic subjects. His photos are often described as ethereal and surreal, as he captures obscure perspectives of seemingly unremarkable subjects such as cars and streetlights, using no filters and long exposures. Hummel’s approach favors the mingling colors found in paintings, and he employs the effect of ‘’optical mixing,’’ more often associated with oil glazing, by digitally printing the image to metallic c-print paper which is then overlaid with a glossy UV laminate. Hummel show his work at the Heather James Gallery in Palm Springs as well as in Las Vegas.


The subject property is a photograph in excellent condition. A search of auction databases for prints by Hummel yielded no results, indicating that his most common market is at the retail level. Hummel is represented by the Heather James Gallery in Palm Springs, California, where “Pinstriperio” 2004, edition 2/3, and “Orangeventilatorgreen”, 2007, edition 1/3 are offered \$3,000 each. As metallic C-prints on aluminum they are comparable to the medium, edition and subject matter of the subject property in this appraisal. A 10\% collector’s discount, customary for print publishers and galleries, was applied and results in a Fair Market Value conclusion of \$2,700.

Axel Hütte was born in 1951 in Essen, Germany. Between 1973 and 1981 he studied at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf, where he attended Bernd Becher’s fine art course in photography. In 1982 Hütte won a Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD) scholarship to London. Hütte has shown his work primarily in Europe and a major retrospective of his work was held at the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, Madrid, in 2004.


The subject property are a pair of color photographs in excellent condition. A search of auction databases for prints by Axel Hutte yielded results for similar landscape style, color photographs as the subject property. Many of these were recent sales and generally ranged from \$650 to \$11,875, depending on the size of the edition. Editions under 5 frequently sold in a price range of \$7,533 to \$12,000. The subject property is still available in inventory from its publisher, Editions Schellmann, for \$3,000 for the two, indicating that the publisher is the most common market for this work. Lara Cocken, of Lara Cocken Gallery which represents Editions Schellman in New York, would not confirm how many works remain available in the edition. A 10\% collector’s discount, customary for print publishers and galleries, was applied and results in a Fair Market Value conclusion of \$2,700.

\#\#\#\#Biography
Alex Katz is an American painter and print maker who is known for his style emphasizing flatness and color, and for his portraiture. His work is not realistic, as its flatness lacks emotional markers, but rather captures the artist’s interest in representation. Katz studied at the Cooper Union Art School, New York, and Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, Maine. His work is in the public collections of numerous institutions, including  the Brooklyn Museum of Art, New York, National Portrait Gallery, Washington, D.C., Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and Whitney Museum of American Art, New York.

\#\#\#\#Market Analysis
The subject properties are prints in excellent condition. Alex Katz is a well established American artist with substantial retail and auction sales. The subject prints were all produced at Simmelink Sukimoto in Los Angeles. "Morning" and "Spruce" are both in current inventory indicating that the publisher is the most common market for those prints. "Daytona Beach", a set of five prints, is sold out as a set, but individual prints from broken sets are available. In addition, offerings of the set were sought in the retail market. The Fair Market Value conclusion is based on an analysis of publisher and retail sales.\newpage{}\begin{tabular*}{\textwidth}{l@{\extracolsep{\fill}}@{\extracolsep{0pt}}@{\extracolsep{\fill}}r}

The subject property, a suite of five prints, has sold out the edition at its publisher, Simmelink Sukimoto in Los Angeles. It was originally offered as a set for \$7,500 and individually for \$1,500 each. According to Doris Simmerlink, individual prints are still available for \$1,500, but a complete set of impressions with the same numbering is not. Therefore the publisher is no longer the most common market for the suite. A search of auction records did not locate any sales of this suite, although two sales of a three print suite of woodcuts with a nature theme, “Northern Landscape,”1992 was located, for \$2,420 and \$2,475. A search of retail offerings located two complete numbered editions of “Daytona Beach.” The suite is offered at Marlborough Graphics in New York for \$9,500. It also is offered at the Senior and Shopmaker Gallery in New York for \$12,000. A 10\% collector’s discount, customary for print publishers and galleries, was applied and results in a Fair Market Value conclusion of \$8,550.

\#\#\#\#Biography
Ellsworth Kelly is an American artist best known for his abstract compositions which have been influenced by Surrealism and Neo-Plasticism. He attended the Pratt Institute, Brooklyn, School of the Museum of Fine Art, Boston, and the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, Paris.  Kelly received a retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, and has exhibited at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, and Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York.

\#\#\#\#Market Analysis
Ellsworth Kelly is a well established artist with substantial gallery and auction sales. The four lithographs in the collection are in excellent condition and were published by Gemini G.E.L. Editions in Los Angeles. Two of the prints entitled "Green" and "Yellow," are still available through Gemini G.E.L. and, therefore the publisher is the most common market for these works. The editions of the two prints entitled "Sunflower I" and "Sunflower II" have sold out. Therefore, the most common market for the latter is based on an analysis of auction sales and retail offerings.\newpage{}\begin{tabular*}{\textwidth}{l@{\extracolsep{\fill}}@{\extracolsep{0pt}}@{\extracolsep{\fill}}r}

The subject property is a print in excellent condition. Kelly’s plant print portfolio has received scholarly and public attention through the exhibition \emph{Drawn from Nature: The Plant Lithographs of Ellsworth Kelly}, which traveled to museums in the US and Europe in 2005-2006. A survey of auction sales located only four sales of Kelly’s plant prints ranging from \$4,000 to \$6,000, including one sale of the subject property in 2008 at Los Angeles Modern Auctions for \$4,000, well below its estimate of \$6,500 to \$8,000 (12/7/08, lot \#13). According to Valerie McKinnon of Gemini G.E.L., the print is sold out of its edition. She stated that the current Fair Market Value of the the print is \$9,000. She stated that this value opinion is based on a number of factors including how quickly the edition sold out, but affirmed that such information is proprietary to Gemini G.E.L. and declined to disclose any of the specific factors or any sales information about the edition. A survey of galleries selling Kelly prints located one offering of “Sunflower I” at the Neptune Gallery in Washington DC for \$11,000.


In this instance, there is divergent data relating to the valuation of this property. Although a completed auction sale was located, it is already five years old and took place during the previous market downturn. The small number of sales of plant prints located indicates that there is a limited market at auction for these works. While a comprehensive picture of sales of the print at the gallery level is difficult to construct because of the confidentiality of private sales, it is reasonable that retail buyers will seek this work at galleries that sell Kelly’s prints. Therefore, the gallery level is determined to be the most common market for the subject property. The Fair Market Value conclusion \$9,900 is based on the Neptune Gallery price of \$11,000 with a 10\% collector’s discount, customary for print publishers and galleries. This conclusion also is consistent with the Gemini G.E.L. opinion.

The subject property is in excellent condition. Kelly’s plant print portfolio has received scholarly and public attention through the exhibition \emph{Drawn from Nature: The Plant Lithographs of Ellsworth Kelly}, which traveled to museums in the US and Europe in 2005-2006. A survey of auction sales located only four sales of Kelly’s plant prints ranging from \$4,000 to \$6,000, including one sale of a work similar to the subject property,“Sunflower I,” in 2008 at Los Angeles Modern Auctions for \$4,000, well below its estimate of \$6,500 to \$8,000 (12/7/08, lot \#13). According to Valerie McKinnon of Gemini G.E.L., the edition of “Sun Flower I” has sold out. She stated that Gemini’s current Fair Market Value opinion of “Sunflower II” is \$12,000, which is \$3,000 higher than Gemini’s Fair Market Value opinion for “Sunflower I”. She stated that this value opinion is based on a number of factors including how quickly the edition sold out. However, she declined to disclose any specific information about the sales of prints from either edition.


An investigation of the retail and auction markets yielded one print from “Sunflower II” available at the Susan Sheehan Gallery in New York for \$14,000. One sale of a print from this edition was found. However, it took place five years old and took place during the market downturn. The small number of sales of plant prints located indicates that there is a limited market at auction for these works.


In this instance, there is divergent data relating to the valuation of this property. While a comprehensive picture of sales of the print at the gallery level is difficult to construct because of the confidentiality of private sales, it is reasonable that buyers will seek this work at galleries that sell Kelly’s prints. Therefore, the gallery level is determined to be the most common market for the subject property. The Fair Market Value conclusion \$12,600 is based on the Susan Sheehan Gallery price of \$14,000 with a 10\% collector’s discount, customary for print publishers and galleries. This conclusion also is consistent with the Gemini G.E.L. opinion.

The subject property is a lithograph in very good condition. A survey of auction sales located two prints from this edition sold in the past three years ranging from \$4,062 to \$5,000. However, the print is still available from the publisher and is therefore the most common market for the subject property. The published price is \$12,000. A 10\% collector’s discount, customary for print publishers and galleries, was applied and results in a Fair Market Value conclusion of \$10,800.

\paragraph{Fair Market Value: }
\$10,800.00\newpage{}\#\#Robert Kelly

\#\#\#\#Biography
Robert Kelly is an American artist interested in the metaphysics of mark-making. He obtained his BA and MA at Harvard University. Primary to Kelly’s investigations are the tension and logic of framing devices, such as edges, angles and cuts, as well as positive and negative space. His work is included in permanent collections of institutions, such as the University of New Mexico Art Museum, Brooklyn Art Museum, New York, Museum of Fine Arts in Santa Fe, New Mexico, Smith College Art Museum, Massachusetts, and Milwaukee Art Museum.

\#\#\#\#Market Analysis
Kelly is a mid career artist whose work sells mainly at the gallery level. The subject properties are a group of monoprints--unique works--from an extended series of works under the title "Natura Prima," some of which are editioned works and others which are not, as in the present case. A survey of auction sales also did not locate any sales of monoprints. No retail offerings of monoprints from the series were located. Lithographs in editions of 30 in this series similar to the subject properties are offered at the Anne Reed Gallery in Ketchum, Idaho for \$1,200 (see Figure 2 in Item 47).  According to Barbi (Anne) Reed, the artist states that the monoprints were originally sold for \$1,500 each in 2005 and would now be offered for \$2,000. The latter price also is similar to the current published price at Universal Limited Art Editions of monotypes by Joey Kotting, another mid career artist represented in the NVCI collection. It is therefore used as the basis for the Fair Market Value conclusion of \$1,800, which also reflects a 10\% collector's discount, customary for print publishers and galleries.\newpage{}\begin{tabular*}{\textwidth}{l@{\extracolsep{\fill}}@{\extracolsep{0pt}}@{\extracolsep{\fill}}r}

\$1,800.00\newpage{}\#\# Imi Knoebel

\#\#\#\#Biography
Imi Knoebel is a German artist influenced by Constructivism and the Bauhaus. Knoebel studied at the Werkkunstschule, Darmstadt, and the Dusseldorf Art Academy. He works in a variety of media including painting, collage, mixed media, prints and photography. His non-objective art uses reoccurring techniques, such as knife cuts, and primary colors. Knoebel’s rigid adherence to reductive fundamentals of art is further demonstrated through his focus on the economy of means, materials and structure. He has had solo exhibitions at the museums in Dusseldorf, Winterhur, and Bonn, and participated in Documenta 5, 6, 7, and 8. The Haus der Kunst, Munich, held Knoebel’s retrospective in 1996. 

\#\#\#\#Market Analysis
Imi Knoebel is a mature artist with an established retail and auction market in Europe and the United States. Since 2008, his unique works have sold at auction from the low thousands to more than \$140,000. Prints by the artist have sold from \$221 to \$8,870. Included in the collection are two sets of prints, "Tur and Tor," which is a suite of three prints, and "Untitled," which is a suite of four prints, all in excellent condition. Both sets are still available from their publishers, and this is the basis of the Fair Market Value conclusions.

\#\#\#\#Biography
Joey Kotting is a mid-career British artist now based in Los Angeles. His prints, drawings, paintings and collages explore political issues and the state of the human condition. Kotting earned his BFA from Brighton Polytechnic and his MFA from the Tyler School of Art at Temple University. He had his first solo exhibition in New York at Esso Gallery in 1996 and subsequently has had exhibitions in New York, Paris and Lisbon. His work has also been included in a number of group exhibitions in the United States. Kotting teaches art at California State University, Bakersfield.

\#\#\#\#Market Analysis
Kotting sells his work primarily through his publisher and  galleries. The subject properties are two unique mixed print media works from a series of twenty unique mixed print media works published by Universal Limited Art Editions. Other works in the series are still available and therefore this is the most common market for these works. The published price is \$2,000 per work. A 10\% collector's discount, customary for print publishers and galleries, was applied and results in a Fair Market Value conclusion of \$1,800 for each.\newpage{}\begin{tabular*}{\textwidth}{l@{\extracolsep{\fill}}@{\extracolsep{0pt}}@{\extracolsep{\fill}}r}

\$1,800.00\newpage{}\#\#Sol Lewitt

\#\#\#\#Biography
Sol Lewitt is an American artist closely associated with the founding of Conceptual art and Minimalism. Lewitt earned his BFA at Syracuse University, New York, and was influenced by Eadweard Muybridge’s serial photography and Russian Constructivism. The artist is known for creating a vocabulary of shape, line and color which is the basis for his compositions. For Lewitt,  the idea and  process are more important than the final result, the actual artwork. In 1978, the Museum of Modern Art, New York, held a retrospective of Lewitt’s work, and in 1995, a retrospective of his prints. In 2000, a comprehensive exhibition of his work was held at the The San Francisco Museum of Art. His work is in the collection of many major museums including MOMA, the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., the Tate Modern, and the Hirshhorn Museum among others. 

\#\#\#\#Market Analysis
Sol Lewitt is a well established artist with robust sales at both the gallery and auction levels. The subject properties are a series of prints in excellent condition. One of them, "Horizontal Bands (More or Less) Green/Red," is still in the inventory of the publisher, Crown Point Press, and this is therefore its most common market. The editions of the other two prints are sold out. In these cases, the Fair Market Value conclusions are based on sales in the gallery and auction markets.\newpage{}\begin{tabular*}{\textwidth}{l@{\extracolsep{\fill}}@{\extracolsep{0pt}}@{\extracolsep{\fill}}r}

The subject property is a print in excellent condition. It is sold out of the edition, indicating that the most common market must be sought at the retail or auction level. A survey of retail offerings did not locate any offerings or sales of this work. A survey of auction sales did not locate any individual sales of this work, although sales of other aquatints ranged from \$2,300 to \$4,600. Sales of other individual prints including linocuts, woodcuts and silkscreen prints ranged from \$1,250 to \$3,250. Two auction sales of the three prints in this series were located, with one bought in, although Valerie McKinnon of Crown Point Press states that the publisher did not offer them as a set. The most recent, a 2009 sale at Phillips de Pury realized \$6,250 (11/15/09, lot \#64). This sale of prints from the same edition is the most relevant to the subject property and is therefore the basis for the Fair Market Value conclusion of \$2,083 based on one third of this sale.

The subject property is a print in very good condition. According to Valerie McKinnon at Crown Point Press, the edition has almost sold out and there is only a trial proof left. This is therefore still the most common market for this work. This is offered at \$8,000, the same price the numbered prints were offered for. A 10\% collector’s discount, customary for print publishers and galleries, was applied and results in a Fair Market Value conclusion of \$7,200.

\$7,200.00\newpage{}\#\#Richard Long

\#\#\#\#Biography
Richard Long is a British artist best known for Earthworks and experimenting with the idea of impermanence, a theme that would inform his work throughout his career. He studied at the University of the West of England’s College of Art, Bristol, and St. Martin’s School of Art and Design, London. His work is based on the physical act of walking, and he has pioneered a new way to think about the relationship between the artist and environment. Long’s use of walking as an art form was introduced as early as 1967. After 1969, Long created environmental works all around the world, documenting his walks with texts, maps, and photographs. In 1989, he was the recipient of the Turner Prize. In the 1980s, Long began making new types of mud works using handprints applied directly to the wall. He also constructed large lines and circles made of stones, slate, and sticks, often collected on his walks or, in later years, from locations near the exhibition sites.  Solomon R. Guggenheim held a major retrospective in 1986. His earthworks are installed at the Hearst Tower, New York, Museum De Pont, Netherlands, and Houghton Hall, Norfolk, U.K..

\#\#\#\#Market Analysis
The subject properties are three suites of three images, all in excellent condition. Richard Long is a well established artist with sales through both galleries and auctions. A survey of auction sales located a modest number of sales for Long's work, including prints and drawings ranging from \$450 to \$33,687 but did not include any sales of the subject properties. Two of the works in the NCVI collection were published by Brooke Alexander Editions and are still in inventory. The third was published by Editions Schellmann and is also still available through the publisher. Therefore the publisher is the most common market for these works and the Fair Market Value conclusions are based on current published prices.\newpage{}\begin{tabular*}{\textwidth}{l@{\extracolsep{\fill}}@{\extracolsep{0pt}}@{\extracolsep{\fill}}r}

\#\#\#\#Biography
Robert Mangold is a contemporary American visual artist who was born in 1937 and acknowledged as one of today’s most highly accomplished minimalist painters. Although simple, his work requires serious scrutiny and deep contemplation on the part of the viewer. His characteristic arcs and ovals, as seen in the prints in this collection, are reminiscent of the architectural elements frequently employed in minimalism. Robert Mangold’s work investigates approaches to composition in addition to the relationship between an image and its background. In Mangold’s print work, he contrasts bold geometric shapes with hand-drawn lines on muted planes of color. Mangold’s work has received international acclaim and included in the collections of many prominent institutions including the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, Art Institute of Chicago, Museum of Modern Art, New York, and the Tate Gallery, London. His works have been published by Pace Prints.\newpage{}\begin{tabular*}{\textwidth}{l@{\extracolsep{\fill}}@{\extracolsep{0pt}}@{\extracolsep{\fill}}r}

A search of auction records for the subject property indicate a limited secondary market with only one sale of an individual print from this series for \$1,619 through Bloomsbury Auctions, London on 7/02/08. The portfolio of four was offered for sale through Swann’s Auction Galleries in 2002 but went unsold.


The most common market for the subject property is through the publisher, Brooke Alexander Editions where it has been available for sale since 1995. According to Barbara Baruch, the published price of all four prints is \$10,500. A 10\% collector’s discount, customary for print publishers and galleries, was applied and results in a Fair Market Value conclusion of \$9,450.

Exploring the line between abstraction and representation, Georgia Marsh challenges our preconceptions of Nature in her subtle, exquisitely rendered prints and drawings. Her work is widely exhibited in France, Italy and the United States.


A search of auction records for prints by the artist indicate that there is a limited secondary market for works by Marsh with only one lithograph dating to 1991 sold through Freeman’s Auctions on 3/5/10 for \$1,300.


Therefore, the retail market was researched for sales. One of the pair of prints, “Cold Moon II”, is available though Senior \& Shopmaker Gallery for \$1,800. The current pair of etchings is available at Pace Prints where they were published and have been available for sale since 2003. According to Jeffrey Bergman, the current published price is \$2,800. A 10\% collector’s discount, customary for print publishers and galleries, was applied and results in a Fair Market Value conclusion of \$2,520.

Born in Great Britain in 1931, Malcolm Morley attended the Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts in 1952-53 and the Royal College of Art from 1954-1957. Drawn to Abstract Expressionism, he left London for New York in 1958. Morley is regarded as a precursor of Photorealism, for which he coined the term Superrealism. In the early 1970s gestural touches began to break into Morley’s pictures. His subjects were inspired by Greek mythology and Mediterranean scenery encountered on his extensive travels. By the early 1980s Malcolm Morley was well established as a leading Neo-Expressionist. He has received numerous awards, including the inaugural Turner Prize, and his works have been exhibited at numerous public and private institutions, including the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, Whitney Museum of American Art, and Museum of Modern Art, New York.


A search of auction records for the subject property indicate a limited secondary market. No sales of “Wind Surfers” were found, though a similarly brightly-colored lithograph entitled “Beach Scene”, 1982, sold for \$750 and \$1,500 in 2011 and 2012, respectively.


The most common market for the subject property is through Gemini G.E.L., an artists’ workshop and publisher of limited edition prints and sculptures, including the “Wind Surfers” which has been available for sale since its publication in 1987. According to Valerie MacKinnon, the Fair Market Value of prints from this edition of 56 is \$2,000. A 10\% collector’s discount, customary for print publishers and galleries, was applied and results in a Fair Market Value conclusion of \$1,800.

\#\#\#\#Biography
Elizabeth Murray was born in Chicago in 1940. She earned a BFA at the Art Institute of Chicago and an MFA from Mills College in Oakland, California. A pioneer in painting, Murray’s distinctively shaped canvases break with the art-historical tradition of illusionistic space in two-dimensions. Jutting out from the wall and sculptural in form, Murray’s paintings and watercolors playfully blur the line between the painting as an object and the painting as a space for depicting objects. Murray’s paintings often include images of cups, drawers, utensils, chairs, and tables. These familiar objects are matched with cartoonish fingers and floating eyeballs—macabre images that are as nightmarish as they are goofy. Taken as a whole, Murray’s paintings are abstract compositions rendered in bold colors and multiple layers of paint, but the details of the paintings reveal a fascination with dream states and the psychological underbelly of domestic life.  Murray received the Skowhegan Medal in Painting in 1986, the Larry Aldrich Prize in Contemporary Art in 1993, and a John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation Award in 1999. Her work is featured in many collections, including Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, Museum of Modern Art, New York, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, Art Institute of Chicago, and Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. 

\#\#\#\#Market Analysis
All of the small prints in the NVCI collection are from two series of five color lithographs published in 1995. The five prints from \_{}The Lament Series\_{} and the five from \_{}The Bounding Dog Series\_{} originate from the same initial drawing.

A search of auction records yielded two records of sold works from \_{}The Lament Series\_{}. On 9/27/06, a single print sold for \$360 at Christie's New York, and on 9/05/07, two prints, "Deep Bite" and "Falling Leaf" sold at Christie's, New York for \$1,125 (or \$563 each). 

All five prints from each of these series are available through the publisher Gemini, G.E.L. Therefore the publisher is the most common market for these works. The smaller size prints from \_{}The Lament Series\_{} (13 inches x 10 inches) sell for \$1,000 while the larger prints (16 inches x 16 inches) \_{}The Bounding Dog\_{} series are available for \$2,000. A 10\% collector's discount, customary for print publishers and galleries, was applied and results in a Fair Market Value conclusion of \$900 and \$1,800 respectively.

\#\#\#\#Biography
Born in 1929, Oldenburg began his formal art training at Yale University, graduating in 1951 and then enrolled at the Art Institute of Chicago from 1952 to 1954. 

In 1956, he moved to New York and became interested in environmental art through Allan Kaprow and his "Happenings," and in 1959, had his first one-man show, held at the Judson Gallery, New York, where he exhibited wood and newspaper sculptures and painted papier-mache objects. Using Lippincott, Inc., a fabrication firm, he made some of the objects in metal such as "Geometric Mouse" and "Colossal Ashtray", and, in 1976, a forty-foot clothespin in Philadelphia.

As a Pop artist, Oldenburg celebrates the everyday object with a keen sense of humor. Oldenburg takes a banal object and transforms it into a sculptural form by representing it using radically different materials and scale. Oldenburg is also an extraordinary draftsman and frequently transforms his ideas for monumental outdoor sculptures and landscape reorientations into drawings and prints that are imaginative variants of his ideas about their installation.

His work has been shown in many exhibitions of Pop and contemporary art including the 1964 Venice Biennale. Oldenburg has had numerous gallery and museum exhibitions, including the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, and Museo Guggenheim Bilbao, Spain. Numerous works by the artist have sold at auction.\newpage{}\begin{tabular*}{\textwidth}{l@{\extracolsep{\fill}}@{\extracolsep{0pt}}@{\extracolsep{\fill}}r}

An apple core stands vertically against a white background. It was one of a set of four prints of apple cores corresponding to the four seasons.\paragraph{Market Analysis:}
See the general Biography at the beginning of this section.


A search of auction sales for “Apple Core-Autumn” indicates a limited secondary market for the print with most sales occurring between 2001 and 2006. Based on these sales which included individual prints from the series and complete sets, the price for an individual print ranged between \$1,880 and \$2,390. Since 2006, the only sale of a print from this series was through Clars Auction Gallery on 7/15/12 for \$774.


“Apple Core-Autumn” is still available through through Gemini G.E.L., where it was published in 1990 and is, therefore, the most common market. According to Valerie MacKinnon, the current published price is \$8,000. A 10\% collector’s discount, customary for print publishers and galleries, was applied and results in a Fair Market Value conclusion of \$7,200.

The subject property is a unique screenprint on paper. A search of auction records for properties similar in medium and period to the subject property yielded limited results. In recent years, most similar size and subject screenprints have come up at auction but have not been sold. Only one screenprint, “Eucalyptus” 1997 (13/8 x 9 7/8 inches) was sold through Freeman’s Auction House on 11/05/10 for \$2,250.


Given the lack of similar properties sold at auction the retail market was researched for sales. According to Sabine Kunst of Sabine Kunst Gallery, which published the subject property, the current price is 2400 euros or approximately \$3,139. A 10\% collector’s discount, customary for print publishers and galleries, was applied and results in a Fair Market Value conclusion of \$2,825.

\#\#\#\#Biography
Rauschenberg is best known for paving the way for Pop Art of the 1960's with fellow artist Jasper John by making use of non-traditional materials and questioning the distinction between art and everyday objects. He studied at the Kansas City Art Institute, from 1946–1947, the Académie Julien, Paris in 1947, and with Josef Albers and John Cage at Black Mountain College, North Carolina, from 1948–1950.

Based in New York City from 1950, Rauschenberg developed a new form that he dubbed "combine paintings" initially combining paintings and objects from his own past, but later including more "found" materials like photographs that had no personal connection to the artist. The idea of combining and of noticing combinations of objects and images has remained at the core of Rauschenberg’s work. 

In the ’60s, Rauschenberg turned away from three-dimensional combines and began to work in two dimensions, using magazine photographs of current events to create silkscreen prints. Rauschenberg transferred prints of familiar images, such as John F. Kennedy or baseball games, to canvases and overlapped them with painted brushstrokes. They looked like abstractions from a distance, but up close the images related to each other. Using this new method the artist found he could comment on contemporary society using the very images that helped to create that society. 

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s Rauschenberg concentrated primarily on collage and new ways to transfer photographs. In 1997 the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, staged a major exhibition of his works, showcasing his work and its influence over the second half of the century. Rauschenberg had numerous other gallery and museum exhibitions, including the Philadelphia Museum of Art and National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.

A search of auction records for screenprints from the \emph{Speculations} series produced from 1994-1997 yielded several results, though none of “Daydream”, ranging in price from \$3,600 to \$9,600. Since 2006, prints from the \emph{Speculation} series have sold for between \$4,000 and \$9,600.


The most common market for the subject property is through Gemini G.E.L., an artists’ workshop and publisher of limited edition prints and sculptures, including the “Daydream” from the \emph{Speculations} series since its publication in 1997. A key characteristic of value for limited edition prints at Gemini G.E.L. is the number remaining in the edition. As the print run reaches the end, the value increases. According to Valerie MacKinnon, this edition of 37 is almost sold out and the current published price \$20,000. A 10\% collector’s discount, customary for print publishers and galleries, was applied and results in a Fair Market Value conclusion of \$18,000.

Matthew Ritchie was born in London, England, in 1964, and lives and works in New York. He received a BFA at Camberwell School of Art, London, and attended Boston University. Although often described as a painter, Ritchie creates works on paper, prints, light-box drawings, floor-to-wall installations, freestanding sculpture, websites, and short stories. Ritchie manipulates his works on the computer by scanning his drawings so that images can be enlarged, taken apart, made smaller or three-dimensional, reshaped, transformed into digital games, or given to someone else to execute. Ritchie’s work has been shown in one-person exhibitions at Dallas Museum of Art, Contemporary Arts Museum, Houston, Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and Museum of Contemporary Art, North Miami. His work was also exhibited at the Whitney Biennial in 1997, Sydney Biennale in 2002, and Bienal de São Paulo in 2004.


A search of auction records indicate that there is a limited secondary market for prints by Ritchie. A print entitled “Sea State One” (16 inches x 32 inches) sold through Phillips de Pury \& Company New York on 3/10/07 for \$1,200.


The most common market is through Two Palms Press where “Sea State V” was published and the Andrea Rosen Gallery which represents the artist. According to a representative at Two Palms Press, the edition of 28 was sold out years ago. The last sale was through the Andrea Rosen Gallery in 2008 for \$30,000 which was confirmed by Ms. Rosen. Ms. Rosen states that the market for this particular print has not changed and that the subject property would not be priced differently today. There are no other recorded sales of the subject property. The Fair Market Value conclusion is therefore based on the 2008 sale price of \$30,000.

A glass of water reflected on a table illuminated by the moon in blue and purple tones.\paragraph{Market Analysis:}
James Rosenquist is a leading American Pop artist, best known for his large-scale, fragmented works that bring the visual language of commercial painting onto canvas. He came to prominence among New York School figures like Roy Lichtenstein, Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, and Willem de Kooning. In 1955 he moved to New York and studied at the Art Students League on a scholarship. He earned his living as a billboard painter and in 1960 began to apply similar techniques of grossly enlarged and fragmented images to huge paintings. In his use of mass-produced goods and vernacular culture rendered in an anonymous style, Rosenquist’s work recalls that of Andy Warhol, while his seemingly irrational, mysterious pictorial combinations owe a debt to Surrealism. Rosenquist has had numerous gallery and museum exhibitions, including the Museum of Modern Art, New York, and Brooklyn Museum of Art, New York. In 2012, he was awarded the Isabella and Theodor Dalenson Lifetime Achievement Award.


A search of auction records for prints by the artist indicate that most lithographs from the 70s, in very good condition, sell for between \$1,200 and \$2,000. The most recent sale of the subject property sold at Freeman’s Auctions on 11/07/10 for \$1,875.


The most common market is Brooke Alexander Editions, the publisher of this print where it has been available since its publication in 1972. According to Barbara Baruch, the published price is \$3,500. A 10\% collector’s discount, customary for print publishers and galleries, was applied and results in a Fair Market Value conclusion of \$3,150.

David Row is a contemporary abstract American painter who has continued the traditions of Abstract Expressionism. His work explores the tension between fragments and wholes through his use of geometric forms, undulating lines that push beyond the canvas edge, washes and overlapping layers of paint that reveal his trademark thick, rolling brushstrokes. Row received his Bachelor and Master of Arts at Yale University, Connecticut. The artist is represented in numerous museum collections, including the Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh, Cleveland Museum of Art, Ohio, Museum of Contemporary Art, San Diego, and Brooklyn Museum of Art, New York.


A search of sales records at auction dating back to 2008 yielded several sales of color lithographs produced by the artist, ranging in price from \$550 to \$1,000. However, no sales of “The Kingdom of Time and Place” were found.


The subject property is still in the inventory of Tamarind Institute where it was published in 2003. The publisher is, therefore, the most common market for this work. According to Anne Slattery, the published price is \$1,000. The Fair Market Value conclusion is based on the published price multiplied by five (\$7,500) with the customary 10\% collector’s discount applied.

Rubsamen has had his work shown both in the United States and internationally at galleries, such as Blum \& Poe Gallery, Robert Miller Gallery, and Mae 36 Galerie in Zurich. He currently resides in Düsseldorf, Germany.


A search of auction databases yielded several examples of oil and acrylic on canvas and linen depicting similar subject matter of palm trees set against the sky which have sold for between \$1,364 and \$17,248 depending on the size. However, there were no sales of any ink on paper works similar to the subject property. Moreover, a search of galleries that sell works by the artist had no comparable ink on paper examples available.


The subject property was acquired through Mae 36 Galerie in Zurich, Switzerland. According to the Director, Anna Caruso, the current price of this work is \$5,500. In an email correspondence with Ms. Caruso she states that her gallery does not typically offer discounts. Therefore, no discount is applied and the current price is the basis of the Fair Market Value conclusion.

Six photographs of buildings designed by Mies van der Rohe photographed frontally and in varying degrees of focus. The colors and details have been digitally altered creating a painterly effect.\paragraph{Market Analysis:}
Thomas Ruff was born in 1958 in Black Forest, Germany. Ruff studied photography from 1977 to 1985 with Bernd and Hilla Becher at the Düsseldorf Art Academy. Inspired by the lectures of Benjamin HD Buchloh. Ruff began photographing landscapes eventually photographing the interiors of German living quarters the 1950s to 1970s. This was followed by similar views of buildings and portraits of friends and acquaintances from the Düsseldorf art and music scene.


In 1999 the artist made a series of digitally altered photographs of Modernist architecture by Mies van der Rohe. The series \emph{l.m.v.d.r.} , the initials of the architect, began as a commission offered to Ruff in 1999–2000 in connection with the renovation of Haus Lange and Haus Esters in Krefeld, Germany. Having worked with architectural subject matter since the mid-1980s, Ruff was enlisted to photograph the Krefeld buildings as well as the Barcelona Pavilion and the Villa Tugendhat in Brno, Czech Republic. Ruff has had numerous gallery and museum exhibitions, including the Museum Ludwig, Cologne, and Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago.


A search of auction records for the portfolio of six C-prints yielded no sales though there were several records of sales of individual prints from the series including: “h.u.p. 01”, on 10/29/09 for \$2,420, “h.e.k. 0-4” on 1/28/09 for \$3,630, “w.h.s.10” on 6/21/06 for \$7,200 through Wright Auction House.


The six print portfolio was published by Edition Schellmann and has been available for sale at Schellmann Art since its publication in 2004. It is, therefore, the most common market for the subject property. According to Lara Cocken of Schellmann Art, the current published price for the portfolio is \$20,000. A 10\% collector’s discount, customary for print publishers and galleries, was applied and results in a Fair Market Value conclusion of \$18,000.

\#\#\#\#Biography
Born in 1937 in Omaha, Nebraska, Edward Ruscha was raised in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, where his family moved in 1941. In 1956 he moved to Los Angeles to attend the Chouinard Art Institute, and had his first solo exhibition in 1963 at the Ferus Gallery. In 1973, Ruscha began showing his work with Leo Castelli Gallery in New York. He continues to live and work in Los Angeles, and currently shows with Gagosian Gallery.

Ruscha combines the cityscape of his adopted hometown with vernacular language to communicate a particular urban experience. Encompassing painting, drawing, photography, and artist's books, Ruscha's work holds the mirror up to the banality of urban life and gives order to the barrage of mass media-fed images and information that confronts us daily. Ruscha's early career as a graphic artist continues to strongly influence his aesthetic and thematic approach.

Ruscha has been the subject of numerous museum retrospectives including those organized by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in 1982, the Centre Georges Pompidou in 1989, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in 2000, the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia in 2002, and the Museum of Contemporary Art in Sydney in 2004. Also in 2004, The Whitney Museum of American Art organized two simultaneous exhibitions: "Cotton Puffs, Q-tips®, Smoke and Mirrors: The Drawings of Ed Ruscha", which traveled to the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles and the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., and "Ed Ruscha and Photography". In 2005, Ruscha was the United States representative at the 51st Venice Biennale. The traveling exhibition "Ed Ruscha, Photographer" opened at the Jeu de Paume in Paris in 2006.

In 2001, Ruscha was elected to The American Academy of Arts and Letters as a member of the Department of Art. \_{}Leave Any Information at the Signal\_{}, a volume of his writings and interviews, was published by MIT Press in 2002, and the first comprehensive monograph on the artist, Richard Marshall's \_{}Ed Ruscha\_{}, was published by Phaidon in 2003.

A major retrospective, "Ed Ruscha: Fifty Years of Painting," opened at the Hayward Gallery in London in October 2009 and traveled to the Haus der Kunst, Munich and the Moderna Museet, Stockholm. 

\#\#\#\#Market Analysis
A search of auction records indicate a limited secondary market for  the "Bow-Tie Landscapes". The series came up at auction  at Sotheby's, New York on 3/9/11 (estimated, \$5,000-\$7,000) but did not sell. 

The most common market for the subject property is through Universal Limited Art Editions (ULAE), a fine art print publisher of limited edition prints, including the"Bow-Tie Landscapes".  According to ULAE, the current published price of the three prints are as follows: "Bow-Tie Palm Springs", \$3,500, "Bow-Tie Rivet", \$2,500, "Bow-Tie Screwhead", \$2,500. The higher published price of "Bow-Tie Palm Springs" is attributable to its larger format of
21 1/2 inches x 43 inches. The other two are 17 1/2 inches x 29 inches. A 10\% collector's discount, customary for print publishers and galleries, was applied and results in a Fair Market Value conclusion of \$3,150 and \$2,250 for the "Bow-Tie Palm-Springs Landscapes".

A series of etchings featuring single and pairs of water glasses, some empty, others half full, against a background of black, gray and blue tones.\paragraph{Market Analysis:}
See general Biography at the beginning of this section.


A search of auction records for prints from the “Sunliners” series indicate a limited secondary market for the complete series of seven prints, although a number of individual prints sold between \$938 and \$1,625 in 2007-2008. There is only one sale of the complete set of seven prints at Christie’s New York in October 2009 for \$6,875


“Sunliners” was published by Pace Prints where it has been available for sale since its publication in 1995. It is, therefore, the most common market for the subject property. According to Jeffery Bergman, a Pace Print representative, only two sets of the edition of 50 remain, and the published price is \$18,000. A 10\% collector’s discount, customary for print publishers and galleries, was applied and results in a Fair Market Value conclusion of \$16,200.

Abstract composition of white and blue circular forms on orange field.\paragraph{Market Analysis:}
Ryan received his BFA from the University of Texas, Austin, and MFA from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, where he studied under Dave Hickey and Libby Lumpkin. While object-like in physicality, Ryan’s works soften the distinction between the architectural, geographic, biomorphic, and abstract. In distorting the viewer’s perception of depth, plane, and contour, Ryan creates ambiguous, but alluring compositions that engage with both quirky artifice and aesthetic formality.


His work has been exhibited at the Laguna Art Museum, Las Vegas Art Museum, Galerie Jean-Luc \& Takako Richard, Paris, Seomi \& Tuus, Seoul, Davidson Contemporary, New York, and James Kelly Contemporary, New Mexico.


A search of auction records yielded no results for paintings by David Ryan. The most common market for his work is through galleries. Most recently he has had a solo show at the Mark Moore Gallery where acrylic and felt works on coraform, a material that has replaced MDF as the substrate. According to Assistant Director, Matthew Gardocki, the subject property would now be sold for \$6,500. A 10\% collector’s discount, customary for print publishers and galleries, was applied and results in a Fair Market Value conclusion of \$5,850.

\$5,850.00\newpage{}\#\#Katia Santibanez

\#\#\#\#Biography
Katia Santibanez is a painter whose work investigates the relationship between nature, architecture, and abstraction of the mind.  She has a strong interest in repeated forms of mark-making in a variety of ways to maximize visual stimulation, and, in doing so, explores concepts of difference, similarity and repetition. Santibanez received her BFA at the Ecole Nationale Superieure des Beaux Arts de Paris. Her paintings and drawings have been included in numerous exhibitions in the United States and abroad. 

\#\#\#\#Market Analysis
Santibanez sells her work primarily at the gallery level. A search of sales records of auction listings dating back to 2009 yielded one sale of an untitled etching with hand coloring in watercolor with a comparable grass motif design produced by the artist in 2003. It was sold through Bloomsbury on 11/3/2009 for \$350. The subject properties are prints in current inventory at Pace Prints and this is therefore their most common market. The Fair Market Value conclusions are based on the current published prices for these works.

\#\#\#\#Biography
Originally a Las Vegas-based photographer who now lives in New York, Ryan Spencer received his BFA in Studio Art from the University of Colorado and a MFA in Photography from the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, N.Y. Although active as an artist in the mid 2000s, Spencer is not currently producing or exhibiting his work.

\#\#\#\#Market Analysis
The subject properties are two black and white photographs in excellent condition. Spencer is not currently active as an artist, and there is no active market for his works at present. According to the artist, the photographs were sold through Dust, a now defunct gallery in Las Vegas, for \$1,000 each. Spencer later moved on to producing unique Polaroid works for \$1,500. He estimates the current price for a work such as the subject property to be \$1,200. However, he cannot confirm any recent sales of this work or any other. Given the limited data available about this artist, and what appears to be a virtually non-existent market for his work at this time, the Fair Market Value conclusion is based on the original sale of the work.\newpage{}\begin{tabular*}{\textwidth}{l@{\extracolsep{\fill}}@{\extracolsep{0pt}}@{\extracolsep{\fill}}r}

\end{longtable}\paragraph{Description:}
A set of three prints of abstract black calligraphic designs against a graded brown and white background.\paragraph{Market Analysis:}
Lisa Stefanelli was born in New Jersey and received her BFA from the Rhode Island School of Design in Providence. An ice skater in her youth, her designs are meant to evoke the movement of the body across time and space. Stefanelli had a solo exhibition at Pierogi in Brooklyn, New York in 2000. She also works as an independent curator.


A search of auction records yielded sales of prints by Lisa Stefanelli for between \$671 and \$2,533 in the period from 2008 to 2010. In 2010 the suite of three prints from the “Trifecta” series sold through Bonhams \& Butterfield for \$671.


The suite of three prints is in the inventory of Durham Press and therefore the publisher is the most common market for this work. According the Gwyneth Fearnhead, Associate Director, 32 of the edition of 45 have sold, and the current published price is \$1,500 each or \$4,500 for all three. A 10\% collector’s discount, customary for print publishers and galleries, was applied and results in a Fair Market Value conclusion of \$4,050.

\#\#\#\#Biography
Born in Rumania in 1914, the artist studied philosophy at the University of Bucharest and architecture in Milan. After the anti-Jewish laws were instituted in 1941, the artist emigrated to the United States and began publishing drawings in \_{}The New Yorker\_{}, a relationship that lasted nearly sixty years. In addition to publishing in magazines, Steinberg created paintings, prints, drawings sculptures and installations. His first solo exhibition was at the Wakefield Gallery in 1943. He had over eight solo exhibitions including two retrospectives, at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, in 1978 and the Institute for Modern Art in Valencia, Spain, in 2002.

\#\#\#\#Biography
Pat Steir was born in 1940, and has been exhibiting her paintings worldwide since the early 1970s. She has worked at Crown Point Press since 1978 and is an accomplished printmaker. In the 1970s, Steir was thinking mainly about signs and symbols, and was close to Minimal and Conceptual artists. She developed an iconography that included isolated brushstrokes and other marks, color charts, sometimes words, sometimes images crossed out. For the past ten years, the images have become denser and she has made her marks by flinging, pouring, and dripping paint. Images of waterfalls resulted naturally from this approach. As in the "From the Boat" series her images also evoke the night sky. In her paintings and prints, she has been drawn to nature. Inventively using etching techniques that capitalize on liquid effects, Steir splatters her medium in spontaneous gestures reminiscent of Abstract Expressionism and East Asian calligraphy.

\#\#\#\#Market Analysis
A search of auction records indicate there is a limited secondary market for prints by the artist with only one sale of a print from the "From the Boat" series which sold at Bonhams and Butterfields in 2008 for \$720. 

The most common market for prints by this artist is Crown Point Press where the artist has worked since 1978. According to Stacie Scammell, the Business Manager, all prints in the "From the Boat" series are sold out. In the past several years they have sold for \$3,000. A 10\% collector's discount, customary for print publishers and galleries, was applied and results in a Fair Market Value conclusion of  \$2,700. \newpage{}\begin{tabular*}{\textwidth}{l@{\extracolsep{\fill}}@{\extracolsep{0pt}}@{\extracolsep{\fill}}r}

Triangles and rectangles in black and gray tones arranged in three registers.\paragraph{Market Analysis:}
Frank Stella was born in Maiden, Massachusetts, studied at Phillips Academy, Andover, and then at Princeton University, New Jersey.


Upon moving to New York City, he reacted against the expressive use of paint by most painters of the Abstract Expressionist movement, instead finding himself drawn towards the “flatter” surfaces of Barnett Newman’s work and the “target” paintings of Jasper Johns. He began to produce works which emphasized the picture-as-object, rather than the picture as a representation of something, be it something in the physical world, or something in the artist’s emotional world. In 1959, his paintings were included in seminal exhibitions, “Three Young Americans” at the Allen Memorial Art Museum at Oberlin College, and “Sixteen Americans” at the Museum of Modern Art, New York. Stella joined dealer Leo Castelli’s stable of artists in 1959.


Stella began his extended engagement with printmaking in the mid-1960s, working first with master printer Kenneth Tyler at Gemini G.E.L. Stella produced a series of prints during the late 1960s. Stella’s abstract prints in lithography, screenprinting, etching and offset lithography (a technique he introduced) had a strong impact upon printmaking as an art.


In the 1990s, Stella began making free-standing sculpture for public spaces and developing architectural projects including created the entire decorative scheme for Toronto’s Princess of Wales Theatre, and lobby of the Moores Opera House on the campus of the University of Houston, in Houston, TX, and a monumental Stella sculpture outside the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.


Stella’s work was included in several important exhibitions that defined 1960s art, among them the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum’s “The Shaped Canvas” (1965) and “Systemic Painting” (1966). His art has been the subject of several retrospectives in the United States, Europe, and Japan. Among the many honors he has received was an invitation from Harvard University to give the Charles Eliot Norton Lectures in 1984.


According to Valerie MacKinnon at Gemini G.E.L. Publishers, the edition has sold out. A search of auction records yielded three sales of “Black Stack” since 2010:


\begin{enumerate}
\item[$\bullet$]at Stair Galleries on 12/02/12 for \$863,
\item[$\bullet$]at Kaminsky Auctions on 12/29/10 for \$1,112
\item[$\bullet$]at the Ro Gallery on 05/04/12 for \$1,200
\end{enumerate}
The Fair Market Value conclusion is based on the most recent sale of the subject property for \$1,200.

\#\#\#\#Biography
Born in 1951 in Asheville, North Carolina, Donald Sultan received his BFA from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill and his MFA from the School of the Art Institute in Chicago. He moved to New York in 1975.  Since his first one-man show in 1977, he has enjoyed a distinguished career as painter, printmaker, and sculptor. His extensive body of work has placed him at the forefront of contemporary art, where he has become best known for his ability to successfully merge the best of yesterday's artistic tradition with a fresh, modern approach that is unique.

Although his paintings fit into the criteria of a still life, Sultan describes these works as first and foremost abstract. The largeness of Sultan's compositions, huge pieces of fruit, flowers, dominoes and other objects, set against the stark, unsettling tar-black, eight-foot square background, dominate the viewer. He is best known for his lemons, flowers and fruit, and states that his subjects develop from previous work. Sultan's work incorporates basic geometric and organic forms with a formal purity that is both subtle and monumental. His images are weighty, with equal emphasis on both negative and positive areas.  Sultan's still lifes have been described as studies in contrast. His powerfully sensual, fleshy object representations are rendered through a labor-intensive and unique method.

Sultan has had numerous solo exhibitions and received two honorary doctorate degrees from The Corcoran School of Art in Washington D.C. and the New York Academy of Art. His work is included in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, Tate Gallery, London, Hirshorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, D.C., Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, and Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. \newpage{}\begin{tabular*}{\textwidth}{l@{\extracolsep{\fill}}@{\extracolsep{0pt}}@{\extracolsep{\fill}}r}

A series of three prints depicting densely patterned images of oranges on branches in deep black tones against a white background. The handmade paper is layered with coloured paper pulp and delicate overlays of litho ink; jigsaw-cut woodblocks create embossed relief areas, fitting together like pieces of a puzzle; elegant flocked ‘drippings’ are paired with etched flat oranges, creating a monochromatic harmony of positive and negative spaces. The title and date are inscribed in pencil on the left border of each print.\paragraph{Market Analysis:}
See the General biography at the beginning of this section.


A search of sales records of auction listings yielded no sales of the subject property. Therefore, the retail market was investigated. A set of these three prints are available through the Mary Ryan Gallery for \$10,000. The subject property was published by the Singapore Tyler Print Institute where, according to the Director of the STPI, these three prints are available for the following:


\begin{enumerate}
\item[$\bullet$]March 11 (23.25 x 28.25 in) SGD3,400 = \$2,725
\item[$\bullet$]March 18 (23.25 x 28.25 in) SGD2,800 = \$2,245
\item[$\bullet$]March 19 (23.25 x 28.25) SGD 4,100 = \$3,287
\end{enumerate}
Since prints from the edition of twenty are still available through STPI, it is the most common market for the subject property. A 10\% collector’s discount, customary for print publishers and galleries, is applied and results in a Fair Market Value conclusion of \$2,254, \$2,022 and \$2,960.

Close-up of three sunflower blooms in yellow, black and white colors.\paragraph{Market Analysis:}
A search for auction records of “Sunflowers, September 17, 1996” yielded no results. However, screenprints of similar size (approximately 24 inches x 24 inches) and subject matter of vibrantly colored close-ups of flowers yielded examples that have sold in recent years for between \$1,840 and \$4,392. The majority of these are from the “Poppy” series, 2002, and have sold in the \$2,000 to \$3,000 range. The most recent sale of “Four Reds” (18 inches x 24 inches) at Bonhams on 11/12/12 for \$3,125 is the the closest in sales date and type to the subject property.


Although there are no auction records for “Sunflowers, September 17, 1996”, it is available through Lococo Publishers for \$3,000, and comparable in price to the screenprints sold at auction discussed above. Therefore, the “Sunflower” print at Lococo Publishers and Gallery is the basis for the Fair Market Value conclusion.

\$125.00\newpage{}\#\#Andy Warhol

\#\#\#\#Biography
Andy Warhol is recognized as one of the most influential artists of the 20th century. From his beginnings as a commercial illustrator to his later activities as painter, sculptor, filmmaker and printmaker, Warhol not only explored but defined Pop culture themes and style. More than twenty years after his death, Warhol's influence on contemporary art and in the art market continues. Warhol's art continues to be regularly exhibited in major venues around the world and his work commands among the highest sales prices at retail and at auction worldwide.

\#\#\#\#\#Market Overview
Warhol's market is well established at the auction and retail levels worldwide, with numerous sales in a variety of media. The subject properties are four screenprints from a 1974 suite of ten floral images, all in excellent condition. There are two versions of this portfolio, \_{}Flowers (Black and White)\_{}, issued in an edition of 100, and \_{}Flowers (Hand-Colored)\_{}, issued in an edition of 250, where Warhol's studio assistants hand colored the individual prints. A survey of auction sales located a small number of sales of the complete suite of ten prints, as well as of individual prints from the black and white suite, and a much larger number of sales for of the colored versions. A comparison of those sales did not reveal a consistent pattern regarding a market preference for the hand colored vs the black and white versions of the "Flowers" screenprints. 

Two recent sales of the complete \_{}Flowers (Black and White)\_{} portfolio were located. In 2011, the first impression of the edition sold for \$22,500 at Phillips de Pury \& Co (4/21/11, lot \#22), or approximately \$2,250 per print. In 2010, an unidentified impression of the complete portfolio sold for \$38,353 through the online Artnet Auctions (12/16/10, lot \#38843), or \$3,850 per print. In 2009, two prints from the portfolio sold for \$6,875 (Phillips de Pury \& Co., 11/15/09, lot \#470), or approximately \$3,440 per print. There have been only five sales of individual prints ranging from \$2,727 to \$3,600.

There have been several sales of the \_{}Flowers (Hand-Colored)\_{} portfolio in recent years, ranging from a low of \$9,470 to a high of \$85,034, with the median sale at \$28,125 (Sothebys, 4/26/12, lot \#447) or approximately \$2,812 per print. A group of four prints, including three with hand coloring, sold at Sotheby's for \$12,500 (4/26/12, lot \#448), or approximately \$3,125 per print. There have been numerous individual print sales ranging from \$1,976 to \$5,750, with the median sale at \$3,641.

These auction results indicate that there appears to be some volatility in the market for both the individual prints and complete portfolios from the \_{}Flowers\_{} (Black and White)\_{}  and \_{}Flowers (Hand-Colored)\_{} suites,  with no consistent trends up or down in the past five years. Median prices for individual prints appear to fall in a similar range, between \$3,000 to \$4,000. Not all of the subject prints in the NVCI collection are represented in the individual sales of the black and white portfolio screenprints. Where possible, the Fair Market Value conclusion is based on an analysis of comparable sales of the specific titled works. In the case of those where a direct comparable could not be located, the Fair Market Value conclusion is based on sales of a similar work.\newpage{}\begin{tabular*}{\textwidth}{l@{\extracolsep{\fill}}@{\extracolsep{0pt}}@{\extracolsep{\fill}}r}

No sales of this individual print from the \emph{Flowers (Black and White)} portfolio were located, but several sales of the hand colored versions of the print were found, ranging from \$2,000 to \$5,100, with the median price represented by a sale at Bonhams \& Butterfields in 2011 for \$3,050 (5/3/11, lot \#353).

Two sales of the subject print were located, both for \$3,500 (Heritage Auctions Texas, 2/23/13, lot \#86382 and Bonhams San Francisco, 5/1/12, lot \#314). This is consistent with the median for sales of individual prints from the \_{}Flowers (Black and White)- and \emph{Flowers (Hand-Colored)} noted in the Warhol Market Overview. Therefore, the the Fair Market Value conclusion of \$3,500 is based on the sales for the two prints most comparable to the subject property.

\#\#\#\#Biography
Leslie Wayne is a New York-based abstract artist. Wayne received her BFA in sculpture from Parsons School of Design and her MFA in painting from University of California, Santa Barbara. She is a recipient of the Buhl Foundation Award for abstract photography and the Adolph and Esther Gottlieb Foundation artist’s grant. Wayne’s works have been featured at a number of galleries, including Jack Shainman Gallery, New York, Halsey Institute of Contemporary Art, Charleston, Galerie Doris Wullkopf Darmstadt, Germany, Haines Gallery, San Francisco, and Galeria Leyendecker, Santa Cruz de Tenerif, Spain. Wayne has also exhibited pieces at institutions such as the Whitney Museum of American Art and New Museum for Contemporary Art, New York.

\#\#\#\#Market Analysis
The subject properties are prints in excellent condition. A search of sale records of auction listings for screenprints by Leslie Wayne yielded no results although several sales of works in oil were found. The subject properties are currently in the inventory of Durham Press where both were published and have been available for sale since 2003. The publisher is, therefore, the most common market for this work. According to Associate Director, Gwyneth Fearnhead, twenty out of the edition of 40 have sold so far for \$1,500. A 10\% collector's discount, customary for print publishers and galleries, is applied and results in a Fair Market Value conclusion of \$1,350 for each print.\newpage{}\begin{tabular*}{\textwidth}{l@{\extracolsep{\fill}}@{\extracolsep{0pt}}@{\extracolsep{\fill}}r}

Winters received a BFA from Pratt University, New York, in 1971. Over the course of his career Winters has expanded the concerns of abstract art, beginning with botanically inspired images (cells, spores, seeds) and going on to explore biological processes, scientific and mathematical fields, and issues raised by the interaction of information technologies and the human mind. He maintains a strong modernist sensibility that reveals itself in the symbolic languages of figures and lines he develops in his work. Winters has had solo exhibitions at Tate Gallery, London, Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, Whitechapel Art Gallery, London, and is included in the collection of the Kunsthalle Basel, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and Irish Museum of Modern Art, Dublin. Winters lives and works in New York City and Columbia County, New York.

Jack Youngerman, was born in Louisville, Kentucky, and was educated at the University of North Carolina, the University of Missouri, and the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Youngerman creates illusions with a series of prints based on a single geometric form. The central figure remains constant, as does its undefined background. Only the colors vary to create subtle changes in the way the object is perceived and its relationship to the surrounding area. Youngerman's honors include the National Council of Arts and Sciences Award in 1966, a National Endowment for the Arts Award in 1972, and a Guggenheim Fellowship Award in 1976. Between 1950 and 1982 he had thirty-five one-man shows and has participated in more than sixty-six group shows. Public collections with his works include the Art Institute of Chicago, Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., Museum of Modern Art, New York, the Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, and Museum of Fine Art, Houston. \newpage{}\begin{tabular*}{\textwidth}{l@{\extracolsep{\fill}}@{\extracolsep{0pt}}@{\extracolsep{\fill}}r}

The challenge of trying to capture the properties of light eventually led her to focus on photography. Her large black and white grids of natural forms illustrate the serial aspects of nature and the rhythmic repetition inherent in our environment. Her most recent color photographs are her first foray into digitally-altered photography. She has also created publicly commissioned sculptures around the world, including a fountain at the site of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. 
  	  	  	
Her photographs have been shown at the Whitney Biennial, New York, the Sydney Biennial, Australia, and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and are included in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, Whitney Museum of American Art, New York and the Los Angeles County Museum as well as numerous private collections.
