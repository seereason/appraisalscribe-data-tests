\end{longtable}Dear Mrs. Choi:

According to our contract signed by you on September 24th, 2013, we have prepared the following Self-Contained report for the property represented as belonging to Juliet Choi. The subject property consists of six paintings and a woodblock print .


You provided us with the information that indicates that Juliet Choi owns the subject properties listed above in their entirety. I examined the properties in the presence of Juliet and Allan Choi at the offices of Thompson \& Martinez Fine Art Appraisals at 7445 Girard Avenue, \#6, La Jolla, CA.


This appraisal report provides the appraisal conclusion of Fair Market Value for the intended use of Estate Tax.(Unexpected XTag: NTree (XTag "br" []) [])Fair Market Value is defined as “The price at which the property would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to buy or sell and both having reasonable knowledge of relevant facts. The fair market value of a particular item of property includible in the decedent’s gross estate is not to be determined by a forced sale price. Nor is the fair market value of an item of property to be determined by the sale price of the item in a market other than that in which such item is most commonly sold to the public, taking into account the location of the item wherever appropriate.’’ 26 CFR Estate Tax Regulation 20.2031-1(b).


After thorough consideration of available facts and statistics, the Fair Market Value for the subject properties is \textbf{one million three hundred forty thousand one hundred nine dollars (\$1,340,109)}. The effective date of value for this appraisal is September 10th, 2008. This professional opinion is based upon my knowledge and experience in the valuation of fine arts. This appraisal is based on my research and analysis of the properties and knowledge of relevant markets where the properties are traded.


I am a “qualified appraiser’’ within the meaning of Internal Revenue Reg. 1.170A-17(b) and am not an excluded appraiser within the meaning of 1.170A-17(b)(5). I hold the Accredited Senior Appraiser designation from the American Society of Appraisers. My background, education and experience qualifies me to make appraisals of the type of property that is the subject of this appraisal. A complete list of my qualifications can be found in the Credentials section that is included in this report. I understand that the appraisal will be used in connection with a tax return or claim for refund. I also understand that, if a substantial or gross valuation misstatement of the value of the property claimed on the return or claim for refund results from this appraisal, I may be subject to a penalty under section 6695A of the Internal Revenue Code, as well as other applicable penalties. I affirm that I have not been barred from presenting evidence of testimony before the Department of the Treasury or the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to 31 U.S.C. section 330(c).


This is a Self-Contained report that was prepared to conform to the Code of Ethics of the American Society of Appraisers and the current version of the \emph{Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice, the 2012-2013 Edition} (USPAP), published by the Appraisal Foundation. I have no past, present or contemplated future interest in the properties included in this report. my fee was not contingent on any value finding.


This \pageref{LastPage} page report consists of a letter of transmittal, scope of work, definitions, privacy statement, assumptions and limiting conditions, certification, description, photographs, narrative, glossary, bibliography and credentials. All these elements must be present for the value conclusion to be valid.


The information in this report is confidential. All notes, electronic, work copies and photographs remain the property of the appraiser and are retained for five years, and/or two years after the conclusion of any litigation. All documents are shredded or otherwise defaced prior to disposal.


The submission of this report completes my assignment and obligations. Any further consultation, preparation of additional reports, testimony, or appearances in court or before any governmental forum in reference to the properties described in this appraisal will require additional fees to cover the required services. The aforementioned fees will be billed at the rate commensurate with the timing of the appraisal.


Thank you for allowing us to be of service to you.

\authorsignature\newpage{}\newpage{}\section{Scope of Work}
Thompson \& Martinez Fine Art Appraisals, Inc. was hired by Juliet Choi to reach an opinion of the Fair Market Value of seven artworks by Zhang Daqian belonging to the Choi family. Based on my discussion with Client, as well as the intended use of the report, the type and location of the subject properties and the effective date of valuation, the Appraiser has selected the type of value, the relevant market, the information researched and the analysis to be applied. To complete this assignment I consulted authoritative publications and on-line sources, reviewed published and on-line market data and interviewed knowledgeable dealers and others regarding the subject properties and their relevant markets.


This report is intended to be an objective, independent, unbiased and credible analysis of known facts. During the course of my examination, research and analysis, I have endeavored to be accurate and to use due diligence. This opinion of value was developed using appraisal methods that are within the accepted standard of care for the appraisal profession and within the boundaries of typical practice.


This appraisal document states the majority of information analyzed, the appraisal procedures followed, and the reasoning that supports the analysis, opinions and conclusions under the requirements of the \emph{Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice, the 2012-2013 Edition} (USPAP). It is considered a summary report. The documentation substantiating the value reported is held in the appraiser’s files.

\newpage{}\section{Type of Value}
This report serves as documented evidence of this appraiser having witnessed the subject property and identified, described and valued the subject property in the context of determining Fair Market Value. \section{Intended Use}
The intended use of this report, as stipulated, is to evaluate the subject properties and provide an assessment of Fair Market Value of a collection of contemporary art for the intended use of Estate Tax. No other use is valid or condoned.\section{Intended Users of this report}
The intended users of this report are: Mrs. Juliet Choi and the IRS. There are no other intended users or uses.\section{Definition of Value}
Fair Market Value is defined as ``The price at which the property would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to buy or sell and both having reasonable knowledge of relevant facts. The fair market value of a particular item of property includible in the decedent’s gross estate is not to be determined by a forced sale price. Nor is the fair market value of an item of property to be determined by the sale price of the item in a market other than that in which such item is most commonly sold to the public, taking into account the location of the item wherever appropriate.’’ 26 CFR Estate Tax Regulation 20.2031-1(b).\section{Approaches to Value}
For this appraisal three valuation methods were considered (from Soucy and Smith, eds, \emph{The Appraisal of Personal Property – Principles, Theories, and Practice Methods for the Professional Appraiser}, 1994.). The three valuation methods are:\begin{compactitem}\item[$\bullet$]\textbf{Cost Approach to Value} method estimates either the reproduction or replacement of a property, either new or depreciated.\item[$\bullet$]\textbf{Income Approach to Value} method estimates the present worth of anticipated future benefits of owning income producing properties or objects.\item[$\bullet$]\textbf{Market Comparison Approach to Value} method estimates value by comparison with properties sold in the relevant market with adjustments for all differences that affect value, such as differences in characteristics of value, in market layer, and in time exposed to the market in order to arrive at the most apposite estimate of value.\end{compactitem}For this appraisal three valuation methods were considered. The three valuation methods are (as defined by The American Society of Appraisers handbook, Principles of Valuation: Personal Property Valuation Methodology – Research and Analysis):


\begin{compactitem}
\item[$\bullet$]Cost Approach to Value method estimates either the reproduction or replacement of a property, either new or depreciated.
\item[$\bullet$]Income Approach to Value method estimates the present worth of anticipated future benefits of owning income producing properties or objects.
\item[$\bullet$]Market Comparison Approach to Value method estimates value by comparison with properties sold in the relevant market with adjustments for all differences that affect value, such as differences in characteristics of value, in market layer, and in time exposed to the market in order to arrive at the most apposite estimate of value.
\end{compactitem}
The Market Comparison Approach was chosen for this assignment. The Cost and Income Approaches to value were considered but not appropriate to this assignment. Although the cost approach would be able to replicate the subject properties in form, it would not have represented their age, history and desirability. The income approach also was not appropriate because an income could not easily be derived from these properties. The properties have been placed in the appropriate level of the market considering properties of similar quality, period, style, significance, condition, rarity, and utility, based on market data and comparable sales gathered in the appropriate markets. Market data includes auction records, retail and private sales, dealer’s inventories, catalogues, published price lists and price guides. The appraisers relied on contacts, field notes and conversations with other professionals in this field. Sources are listed at the end of the report.

\begin{description}\item[Excellent:] The object's stability and state of preservation (i.e. wear and/or losses to paper, decoration, pigment, chips etc.) exhibits stable condition or integrity; function or artistic intent is structurally sound; no restoration material added and no significant repairs.
\item[Very Good:] State of preservation is near original condition; object exhibits stabilization/conservation possibly reflecting slight deterioration from original function or artistic intent.  Structural integrity is maintained.  Some repairs are evident and unobtrusive; no restoration, i.e. all original material.
\item[Good:] State of preservation exhibits clearly its original function and artistic intent, however, the object shows considerable wear.  Stabilization, conservation, restoration reflect original function and maintain artistic intent and structural integrity.  Restoration and repairs are evident; i.e. there may be added material; or, repairs may be needed.
\item[Fair:] State of preservation shows considerable wear and deterioration yet still indicates the general nature of its original form; the object may need structural stabilization, conservation, restoration and/or repairs.
\item[Poor:] State of preservation indicates substantial deterioration compromising original form; the object needs structural stabilization, conservation, restoration and/or repairs.

\subsection{Market Overview}

Zhang Daqian is recognized as one of China's modern masters. He is not only revered for his great skill in the techniques and styles of classical Chinese painting (he was also a notorious forger), but also for developing the splashed ink style of painting, using gouache and ink and colors on paper to create a hybrid Eastern-Western expressionist style.


Zhang's career can be divided into two periods: before 1949 when he lived in China and produced work in the traditional manner, and after 1949, when he briefly stayed in Hong Kong and Macau and then moved to Brazil, Carmel California and finally on to Taiwan where he lived until his death. The paintings in the Choi family collection date from the 1930s and 1940s and are in the traditional style. The provenance of the collection is excellent. The paintings were inherited by Mrs. Choi from her late husband who had received them from his father, Choi Hac-ting, and his brothers, who acquired them directly from the artist as gifts and commissions. Additionally, evidence of the relationship between the Choi family and the painter is found in the inscriptions of three of the artworks (Items 5,6,7), several of which mention family members. Additional documentation of the relationship between the artist and the Choi family is recorded in article published by the Cultural Affairs office of Macau which recounts the three month period in 1949 when Zhang Daqian stayed at the Choi family compound in Macau (Choi San, “Zhang Daqian's Artistic Activities in Macau”, http://www.icm.gov.mo/exhibition.daqian.Activity.asp)


The date of valuation, September 10th, 2008, falls at an unusual time in the global economy and the Chinese art market. A graph of Chinese fine art (Chinese painting, calligraphy, oil painting and Contemporary art ) sales at auction in Appendix A indicates that the Chinese art market grew steadily from from 2004 through 2008. It appears that taken as a whole, the autumn 2008 sales of Chinese art were barely affected by the the global financial crisis as it unfolded in the wake of the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers on September 15th. According to a report by Art Market Monitor of Artron (AMMA), “Art Market in China in 2012 - A Dialogue between East and West”, (p. 55), by early 2009 the market actually entered a three year boom period which peaked in 2011. Art Economics, a research company that studies the international market, reports that after peaking in 2011, reported revenues of Chinese art sold at auction dropped off 24 percent in 2012, and that 2013 is expected to be modestly better than 2012. (“Forging an Art Market in China”, New York Times, October 28th, 2013.)


As one of China's modern masters, and one of the global art market's top grossing artists at auction, the market for Zhang Daqian's work has tracked the accelerating trajectory of the overall Chinese art market (Appendix B). Zhang Daqian was a prolific painter, and, in any given year hundreds of his paintings (both authentic and fakes) come up at auction. Works can sell from the tens of thousands up to the tens of millions. The highest price ever paid for a painting by Zhang Daqian occurred on May 31st, 2011, at Sotheby's Hong Kong when a set of four hanging scrolls, ink and color on paper “Lotus and Mandarin Ducks” (1947), (each 72.64 inches x 37.40 inches) sold for \$24,513,000. In 2011, Zhang Daqian was the top-selling artist in the world at auction with reported sales of \$782.4 million. According to AMMA, in 2012 reported sales of his works fell to \$241.6 million (AMMA, 2012, p.)


One important reason for this recent decline is that the Chinese art market is dysfunctional. According to a recent New York Times article, “Forging an Art Market in China” October 28th, 2013, “... a six-month review found that many of the sales — transactions reported to have produced as much as a third of the country’s auction revenue in recent years — did not actually take place.” Moreover, “the market is flooded with forgeries, often mass-produced, and has become a breeding ground for corruption, as business executives curry favor with officials by bribing them with art.” The Zhang Daqian painting market is part and parcel of this environment.


In 2008, the Chinese art market had not yet entered this period of rapid price acceleration and widespread speculation, fraud and corruption. From 2004 to 2008 the market grew steadily. Zhang Daqian was considered a blue chip artist and his works commanded top prices at auction. The highest price paid for a Zhang Daqian painting during this period was October 24th, 2005 when an abstract landscape from his later career, “Snowcapped Mountains in Switzerland”, 1967, sold for \$2,036,082, (HKD15,800,00) through Sotheby's Hong Kong. In 2008, the top selling Zhang Daqian paintings came from both his early and later career: a splashed ink and color abstract landscape, “Cross-Island Highway Taiwan” from the post-1949 period, sold for \$1,077,47.00 (HKD 8,391,500) through Sotheby's Hong Kong on April 8th, 2008, and a traditional style landscape in the manner of canonical painter, Wang Meng which sold for US\$975,120 (HKD 7,707,500) through Christies, Hong Kong on May 26, 2008.


The paintings in the Choi collection are all traditional style paintings from his early career. Rarity, quality, authenticity and freshness to the market are the standards by which an exceptional work of art is judged. Also important in Chinese painting are the inscriptions on the painting both by the artist and by well-known contemporaries such as artists and collectors. According to Arnold Chang, former head of Sotheby's Chinese painting department and highly respected connoisseur and ink painter, “Hunting in Autumn” is a superb and rare work demonstrating the artist's range and is one of the best of its type. It has three inscriptions by the artist. These elements as well as its excellent provenance indicates that it belongs in the top market level which, in 2008, was between \$500,000 and \$2 million dollars. Mr. Chang also identified the two Tang-Song style figure paintings of deities as highly desirable due to their rarity, subject matter and inscriptions. These works date from the period when the artist lived at Dunhuang and and copied the Buddhist murals there. These works fall into Zhang Daqian's middle market level which in 2008 was between \$100,000 and \$500,000. The remaining paintings, the two bird on branch paintings, fan and signed woodblock print occupy the lower market level which, in 2008, was between \$10,000 and \$100,000.

\newpage{}\#\#Biography

Zhang Daqian was one of the leading artists to emerge in China in the early twentieth century. Born into a family of artists in Sichuan, China, he studied textile dyeing techniques in Kyoto, Japan and returned to establish a successful career selling his paintings in Shanghai.  A staunch supporter of the Kuomintang, he left China in 1948, and, after brief stays in Hong Kong and Macau, moved to Brazil and California, before finally settling in Taipei, Taiwan.

In his early career he became an expert in the techniques and styles of ancient masters. During the Sino-Japanese War, the artist studied of traditional Tang-Song figure painting and ancient monumental landscape painting becoming skilled in both meticulous and free-hand painting styles. In the 1940s, he moved to Dunhuang in Gansu Province where he copied Buddhist wall paintings at cave sites at Mogao and at Yulin, Anxi County. Early in his career he became a collector of ancient Chinese paintings, eventually collecting several hundred works from the Tang to Qing dynasties. In the 1960s, after he had emigrated from China he came under the influence of Abstract expressionists and his style changed radically to abstract compositions of landscapes in splashed ink and colors.  \newpage{}\begin{tabular*}{\textwidth}{l@{\extracolsep{\fill}}@{\extracolsep{0pt}}@{\extracolsep{\fill}}r}

\end{longtable}\paragraph{Description:}
A landscape rendered in ink washes, golden brown and green colors in an archaic style reminiscent of Tang Dynasty (618–907 C.E.) painting. The mounted hunters are set in the middle ground on a green spit of land. Behind them a winding river leads to mountain-scape dotted by autumnal trees in the far distance. Three inscriptions by the artist are placed in the sky above the mountains.\paragraph{Market Analysis:}
The subject property is a superb work and demonstrates the artist’s range as it includes figures, horses, and landscape elements. As one of the best of its type, it is very desirable to mainland Chinese collectors who are particularly fond of Zhang Daqian’s early work. The painting’s colored landscape, known as \emph{jinbi}, or golden landscapce and its use of space is associated with canonical Tang Dynasty painter, Li Zhaodao (ca. 675-750 C.E.). Other important characteristics of value are, the unusual subject matter of meticulously rendered figures on horses and the three inscriptions by the artist, two signatures and three seals. Overall, this a rare work which, in 2008, would have been fresh to the market and attracted much attention at auction.


A search of auction records in the years leading up to September 10th, 2008 yielded sales of three similar quality paintings. All of these paintings include figures in landscapes rendered in an archaic style, date from the late 1930s to late 1940s, are inscribed by the artist and include his signature and seals. The painting sales ranged from \$345,772-\$816,264. “Trading Geese” (Figure 4) sold through China Guardian on November 5, 2007 for \$345,772. “Jinbi Landscape” (Figure 3) sold through Tianjin Wenwu for \$398,550 on November 16th 2004. “Six Sages Gathering in a Bamboo Grove” (Figure 2) sold through Poly International Auctions on November 7th, 2005 for \$816,844. It is inscribed and signed by the artist and has four seals.


The rendering of the landscapes in green and soft golden hues in the “Jinbi Landscape” and “Trading Geese” and “Six Sages” is similar to the subject property. In “Trading Geese”, the main subject is the three figures seated on a riverbank in the foreground. Here, the landscape is more of a setting than the main subject. In “Jinbi”, the landscape is the primary subject and the figure in the boat is a minor feature. In the subject property, the mounted hunters and landscape are given equal prominence. The rendering of both the figures and the horses is meticulous, and the depiction of mounted hunters in a landscape is unusual making the subject property more desirable to “Trading Geese” and “Jinbi”. Although the subject matter is different, the quality of the “Six Sages of the Bamboo Grove” which also gives equal prominence to the figures and the landscape, is closer to the subject property. The six sages and attendant are rendered relaxing on a spit of land in the middle ground. A winding stream leads the viewer’s eye to the misty background. The rendering of the figures and landscape elements, bamboo, rocks and winding river, are meticulous. Like “Hunting in Autumn” the subject, “Six Sages of the Bamboo Grove” is unusual.


As mentioned in the market overview, rarity, quality, authenticity and freshness to the market are the value characteristics of an exceptional work of art, and characterize both the subject property and “Six Sages.” Therefore realized sale of “Six Sages” is the basis of the Fair Market Value Conclusion.

\end{longtable}\paragraph{Description:}
Two deities in three-quarter view are rendered in a traditional outline style known as \emph{baimiao} (outline) floating on top of a body of rippling water. The larger figure wears the headdress and garb of an empress and carries a lotus flower in her hands. Behind her a servant carries a ewer on a tray. Inscriptions are seen in the upper register and in the lower right corner of the painting.\paragraph{Market Analysis:}
According to Arnold Chang, the subject property is a “superb quality” \emph{baimiao} (outline style) painting with a rare inscription written in archaic script. The colophon (inscription) is inscribed by a well-known historical figure Ye Gongchuo who was an artist, collector and connoisseur.


A search of auction records from 2004-2008 did not yield any works of deities rendered in outline style to the subject property. However, a painting of six drunken scholars in a garden setting rendered in a similar outline painting technique, entitled, “Drunken Dancing”, 1952, sold through Rongbao Auctions on May 15th, 2005 for US\$358,696. It depicts a drummer and six drunken scholars dancing against a dense background of trees and rocks. A two line inscription by the artist is on the lower right. It is signed and has three seals of the artist. “Lady Longevity Peach”, which portrays a female deity in ink and color paper, dated 1946, sold through Sotheby’s Hong Kong in October, 2006 for \$303,346. It is inscribed multiple times, once by the artist in the summer of 1946 and then again in 1951 when he dedicated it to his friend. It is signed twice and has four seals of the artist.(Unexpected XTag: NTree (XTag "br" []) [])A painting of a deity seated on a rock against a full moon, “Seated Guanyin”, 1938, ink washes and colors on paper sold through China Guardian in November 5th, 2007 for just under US\$100,000.


All of these works are superbly rendered and inscribed by the artist. Of these three, “Lady Longevity Peach” is most similar to the subject property in terms of subject matter, style, and the number of inscriptions and seals. Like the subject property, the deity rendered in an archaic figural style in three-quarter view and wearing the garb of an empress, and is inscribed multiple times by the artist. It is, therefore, the basis of the Fair Market Value conclusion of the subject property.

\end{longtable}\paragraph{Description:}
A ink and color on paper painting of a deity standing on a lotus holding a cup in one hand and a lotus flower in the other. The inscription at the left of the figure indicates that the artist copied if from a Tang Dynasty wall mural at the Yulin Caves in Anxi County, Gansu Province.\paragraph{Market Analysis:}
According to Arnold Chang, the subject property is a good work of a type much sought after by collectors. It dates from the 1940s when Zhang Daqian famously went to the Buddhist caves at Dunhuang in Gansu Province to study and produce paintings after the Buddhist subjects there. According to Mr. Chang, Buddhist deity paintings produced in this period rarely appeared at auction prior to 2009, so this work would have been very fresh to the market in September of 2008.


A search of auction records yielded three similar era and subject matter paintings. A “Figure of a Bodhisattva” copied from a Buddhist mural at the Mogao Caves at Dunhuang sold through Beijing Rongbao Auctions on May 15th, 2005 for US\$172,705. Like the subject property, it depicts a standing deity and has a single line inscription stating that it is modeled after a Tang period mural. On April 25th, 2004 a painting depicting a standing Guanyin with a single line inscription indicating that is also from this period, signed and with two seals of the artist sold through Christie’s Hong Kong for \$US151,763 (Figure 3). Another painting from this period, “Guanyin on a Lotus Seat”, 1944, sold through Sotheby’s Hong Kong on May 1st, 2005 for \$489,231 (Figure 4). It is a larger more elaborate painting with a long inscription by the artist at the top and is signed and has three seals of the artist.


Of these three paintings, the subject property is most similar to the “Figure of Bodhisattva” (Figure 2). Both paintings feature a standing deity rendered in colors in an archaic style, and have a single line inscription identifying the subject and its location and that the artist copied directly from a Tang Dynasty mural. Therefore the realized sale of this painting is the basis of the Fair Market Conclusion of the subject property.

\end{longtable}\paragraph{Description:}
A depiction of a lady in flowing garb holding a cup seen from behind.\paragraph{Market Analysis:}
In 1941, Zhang Daqian went to Dunhuang to study the murals at the Mogao Grottoes. During the next several years Zhang copied 276 murals. At this time Zhang Daqian would not sell the original paintings of the Buddhist murals. Because there was a demand for them, the manager of Rongbaozhai, a publisher that made woodblock prints of original paintings by well-known artists, convinced Zhang Daqian to allow him to make woodblock prints of these Dunhuang paintings (http://www.chinaculture.org). Zhang would personally inscribe the prints and give them to his friends.


The subject property is an example of one of these. The hand-written inscription by the artist seen on the upper left section of the painting dedicates it to his friend Choi Hac-ting. According to Arnold Chang, the written inscription, which is dated 1949 makes the subject property considerably more valuable than an ordinary print.


Signed prints of Zhang’s Dunhuang paintings are very rare. A search of auction records from 2004-2013 yielded one sale of an inscribed example. It is the same print as the subject property but dedicated to a different patron which sold through Huayi International Auction on December 10th, 2011 for \$21,780. According to the graph of average sales prices of the Chinese art market from 2008 to 2012 (Figure 3) the average price in 2008 was 56\% lower than the average price in 2011. Therefore the Fair Market Value conclusion of the subject property is based on realized sale of the signed print in 2011 discounted by 56\%.

\end{longtable}\paragraph{Description:}
A old man with a staff stands on a rocky cliff looking off into the distance at mountains. It is rendered in ink washes and color on paper. An inscription is seen in the upper right margin.\paragraph{Market Analysis:}
According to Arnold Chang this is a good quality minor work.


A search of auction records between 2004 and 2008 yielded three comparable paintings of fans ranging from \$11,183 to \$16,276. All of these fans date from the early period (1930s and 1940s), depict figures in landscapes and are inscribed, signed and stamped. “Scholar” depicts an old man in a garden setting with rock and bamboo. “An Old Man and Pine Tree” depicts a scholar seated on a branch of pine tree gazing into the distance with mountains in the background. “Boating” is a mounted fan which features a small boat navigating a river among towering mountains. All are rendered with loose brushwork and ink washes. Like the subject property, Of these three, “An Old Man and Pine Tree” is most similar to the subject property in its loose style of painting and subject matter of an old man gazing in the distance and style are similar. Therefore, it is the basis of the Fair Market Value Conclusion of the subject property.
