\end{longtable}Dear To Whom it May Concern::

As requested, I submit the following appraisal report for the property represented as belonging to the Sharon Fairley (Petitioner) and John W. Rogers, Jr. (Respondent). The subject property consists of:


\begin{compactitem}
\item[$\bullet$]Designer Furniture
\item[$\bullet$]Fine Art
\item[$\bullet$]Electronics
\item[$\bullet$]Rugs
\item[$\bullet$]Gym Equipment
\item[$\bullet$]Residential Contents
\end{compactitem}
We were provided with information that indicates that you co-own the subject property listed above in its entirety. This appraisal report provides the appraisal conclusion of Fair Market Value for the purpose of Dissolution of Marriage. In this report, “Fair Market Value” is defined as


“The price at which the property would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to buy or sell and both having reasonable knowledge of relevant facts. The fair market value of a particular item of property includible in the decedent’s gross estate is not to be determined by a forced sale price. Nor is the fair market value of an item of property to be determined by the sale price of the item in a market other than that in which such item is most commonly sold to the public, taking into account the location of the item wherever appropriate.” 26 CFR Estate Tax Regulation §20.2031-1(b).


Because auction sales are publicly recorded, these are the values deemed to be most appropriate in finding prices for properties in tax-related reports and in cases where dispersal of properties is involved. The Fair Market Value assumption is that the value stated is the substantiated price realized what would be paid by the buyer at auction for a comparable property. When there are no appropriate auction records to be used as comparables in determining current value of a property, the most common market for the item might also be deemed to be a source for verified replacement value for a comparable property sold through a primary source. Fair Market Value is used to as the basis for appraisals for charitable contribution, estate taxation, and equitable distribution.


This report will function as documented evidence of this appraiser having witnessed the subject properties, and identified, described and valued the subject properties in the context of estimating Fair Market Value. At the time of the initial examination, on September 4-6, 2014 all property was located at:


\textbf{6115 Paseo Valencia Rancho Santa Fe, CA 92067}


After thorough consideration of available facts and statistics, the FAIR MARKET VALUE of the personal property effectively valued on the date of September 15, 2014, residential contents is:


Fair Market Value: \$124,369 \textbf{one hundred twenty four thousand three hundred sixty nine dollars}


This figure does not reflect a consideration for related sales taxes and deliver/installation charges, which can vary. This professional opinion is based upon our knowledge and experience in the valuation of personal property and residential contents. This appraisal is based on our research and analysis of the property and knowledge of relevant markets where the property is traded.


This is a self-contained appraisal report that was prepared to conform to the Code of Ethics of the American Society of Appraisers and the current version of the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice 2012 (USPAP), published by the Appraisal Foundation. I have no past, present or contemplated future interest in the property included in this report. My fee was not contingent on any value finding.


This \pageref{LastPage} page report consists of an executive summary, photographs, limiting conditions, inventory, summary page, bibliography, credentials and list of sources. All these elements must be present for the value conclusion to be valid.


The appraiser signing this report is a qualified appraiser within the meaning of Internal Revenue Reg. 1.170A-17(b) and am not an excluded appraiser within the meaning of 1.170A-17(b)(5).


Garrett R. Goldfield holds the Accredited Senior Appraiser in Fine Arts designation and Residential Contents. My background, education and experience qualifies me to make appraisals of the type of property that is the subject of this appraisal. A complete list of my qualifications can be found in the Credentials statement included in this report. I understand that this appraisal may be used in connection with a return or claim for refund. I also understand that, if a substantial or gross valuation misstatement of the value of the property claimed on the return or claim for refund results from this appraisal, I may be subject to a penalty under section 6695A of the Internal Revenue Code, as well as other applicable penalties. I affirm that we have not been barred from presenting evidence of testimony before the Department of the Treasury or the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to 31 U.S.C. section 330(c). The information in this report is confidential. All notes, electronic, work copies and photographs remain the property of the appraiser and are retained for five years, and/or two years after the conclusion of any litigation. All documents are shredded or otherwise defaced prior to disposal.


The submission of this report completes our assignment and obligations. Any further consultation, preparation of additional reports, testimony, or appearances in court or before any governmental forum in reference to the property described in this appraisal will require additional fees to cover the required services. The aforementioned fees will be billed at the rate commensurate with the timing of the appraisal.

\authorsignature\newpage{}\newpage{}\section{Scope of Work}
Goldfield Appraisals was hired by  to reach an opinion of the Fair Market Value for a collection of Residential Contents, including: Fine Art, Designer Furniture, Electronics, Gym Equipment and Residential Contents belonging to Sharon Fairley (Petitioner) and John Rogers (Respondent), for the intended use of Dissolution of Marriage. Based on our discussion with , as well as the intended use of the report, the type and location of the subject properties and the effective date of valuation, the appraiser has selected the type of value, the relevant market, the information researched and the analysis to be applied. To complete this assignment we consulted authoritative publications and on-line sources, reviewed published and on-line market data and interviewed knowledgeable dealers and others regarding the subject properties and their relevant markets.


This report is intended to be an objective, independent, unbiased and credible analysis of known facts. During the course of our examination, research and analysis, we have endeavored to be accurate and to use due diligence. This opinion of value was developed using appraisal methods that are within the accepted standard of care for the appraisal profession and within the boundaries of typical practice.


This appraisal document states the majority of information analyzed, the appraisal procedures followed, and the reasoning that supports the analysis, opinions and conclusions under the requirements of the \emph{Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice}, the 2012-2013 Edition (USPAP). It is considered a self-contained report. The documentation substantiating the value reported is held in the appraisers’ files.


A considerable amount of the furniture in this appraisal was unlabeled. It was reported that many of the pieces were purchased in 2006 through an interior design firm. Some of the furniture pieces were labeled with manufacturers: Michael Taylor, Cameron Collection, Charles Pollock and others. These designers typically have high asking prices in the retail market. The secondary markets however reflect a much lower value in most cases. Secondary market sales and listings vary based on characteristics of value of these pieces such as: construction material, date created, style, craftsmanship, condition and other factors. All of these characteristics of value as well as the appraisers experience with previously owned furniture of this type were used in the valuation process.


In the home some of the fine art was created by artists with limited secondary market sales or limited published realized sales. In these instances the retail markets were investigated as well as similar works by the artists contemporaries. Other information in articles, blogs and marketing information were also sought on all the artists in this appraisal.

\newpage{}\section{Type of Value}
The intended use of this report, as stipulated, is to evaluate the subject properties and provide an assessment of Fair Market Value Comparable of a collection of residential contents for the intended use of Dissolution of Marriage. \section{Intended Use}
This report serves as documented evidence of this appraiser having witnessed the subject properties, and identified, described and valued the subject properties in the context of determining Fair Market Value (Comparable). No other use of this report is valid or condoned. The intended use of this report, as stipulated, is to evaluate the subject properties and provide an assessment of Fair Market Value Comparable of a collection of residential contents for the intended use of Dissolution of Marriage. \section{Intended Users of this report}
The intended users of this report are: Sharon Fairley and Lake Toback Divorce and Family Law. There are no other intended users or uses.\section{Definition of Value}
Fair Market Value is defined as “The price at which the property would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to buy or sell and both having reasonable knowledge of relevant facts. The fair market value of a particular item of property includible in the decedent’s gross estate is not to be determined by a forced sale price. Nor is the fair market value of an item of property to be determined by the sale price of the item in a market other than that in which such item is most commonly sold to the public, taking into account the location of the item wherever appropriate.” 26 CFR Estate Tax Regulation §20.2031-1(b). Because auction sales are publicly recorded, these are the values deemed to be most appropriated in finding prices for properties in tax-related reports and in cases where dispersal of properties is involved. The Fair Market Value assumption is that the value stated is the substantiated price realized what would be paid by the buyer at auction for a comparable property. When there are no appropriate auction records to be used as comparables in determining current value of a property, the most common market for the item might also be deemed to be a source for verified replacement value for a comparable property sold through a primary source. Fair Market Value is used to as the basis for appraisals for charitable contribution, estate taxation, and equitable distribution. (As defined by The Appraisal of Personal Property – Principles, Theories, and Practice Methods for the Professional Appraiser, 1994.)\section{Approaches to Value}
For this appraisal three valuation methods were considered (from Soucy and Smith, eds, \emph{The Appraisal of Personal Property – Principles, Theories, and Practice Methods for the Professional Appraiser}, 1994.). The three valuation methods are:\begin{compactitem}\item[$\bullet$]\textbf{Cost Approach to Value} method estimates either the reproduction or replacement of a property, either new or depreciated.\item[$\bullet$]\textbf{Income Approach to Value} method estimates the present worth of anticipated future benefits of owning income producing properties or objects.\item[$\bullet$]\textbf{Market Comparison Approach to Value} method estimates value by comparison with properties sold in the relevant market with adjustments for all differences that affect value, such as differences in characteristics of value, in market layer, and in time exposed to the market in order to arrive at the most apposite estimate of value.\end{compactitem}The Market Comparison Approach was chosen for this assignment. The Cost and Income Approaches to value were considered but not appropriate to this assignment. Although the cost approach would be able to replicate the subject property in form, it would not have represented its age, history and desirability. The income approach also was not appropriate because an income could not easily be derived from this property. The client has been placed in the appropriate level of the market considering properties of similar quality, period, style, significance, condition, rarity, and utility. Based on market data and comparable sales gathered in the appropriate markets. Market data includes auction records, retail and private sales, dealer’s inventories, catalogues, published price lists and price guides. The appraiser relies on contacts, field notes and conversations with other professionals in this field. Sources are listed in this report.\newpage{}\section{Privacy Policy}

\end{compactitem}\newpage{}\section{Assumptions and Limiting Conditions}
This appraisal has been made subject to the following general assumptions and limiting conditions.\begin{compactitem}\item[$\bullet$]Title to the property and present ownership of the property is assumed to be good and marketable unless otherwise stated. Further, the appraisal is made with the understanding that the present ownership of the subject property includes all rights that may be lawfully owned and is not subject to any encumbrances or indebtedness. The client stated that they owned they own the property; ownership was not research or confirmed.\item[$\bullet$]Our analyses, opinions, and conclusions were developed, and this report has been prepared, in conformity with the Code of Ethics as set forth by the American Society of Appraisers and the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice, 2012 of the Appraisal Foundation, Washington, D.C.\item[$\bullet$]The appraisal is based on visual inspection of the appraised item(s). No tests of any kind have been administered unless so stated. Measurements and photographs are made under “field conditions,” and therefore will be as accurate as possible. Measurements are listed in the order of height, width and depth, unless otherwise indicated.\item[$\bullet$]Procedures: The procedures that are outlined below are those that we generally consider appropriate to the circumstances of appraisals done for estate purposes. Where these procedures have been varied, whether at the request of the client or because in our judgment, other procedures were warranted in a particular instance, such variations are noted in the body of the report. The valuation of art requires the identification and evaluation of a work of art through the consideration of style, technique, material, aesthetic quality and condition, among other criteria. Measurements for all works are reported as inches in the order of height x width x depth.\item[$\bullet$]Fine Arts Procedures: Paintings, works on paper and photographs that are framed and/or glazed are generally examined without being removed from their frames. Accordingly, statements as to value may not take into account such factors as the condition and size of print margins, obscured signatures, edition or date information or condition of verso. Works of art are not subjected to x-ray; evaluation of condition is made on the basis of visual examination without the assistance of special equipment other than ultraviolet light, in some instances. Over-painting, prior restorations, etc., may not always be apparent to the unaided eye and may not be revealed through the use of ultraviolet light. No statements are made in this appraisal regarding authenticity of artwork. Some of the lithographs in this appraisal were removed from frames if the frame was damaged, the signature of the artist was not visible or to verify condition.\item[$\bullet$]Disclosure of the contents of the appraisal Report is governed by the Bylaws and Regulations of the Appraisal Foundation USPAP 2012. Neither all nor any part of the contents of this report (especially any conclusions as to the value or the identity of the appraiser) shall be disseminated to the public through advertising, public relations, news, sales, or the media without the prior written consent and approval of the appraiser.\item[$\bullet$]For certain items in the estate no Fair Market Values were found through extensive research. In these cases and others, expert opinions were sought out from collectors, retail dealers and experts at various auction houses on their opinions of the fair market value for these pieces. In some cases the artists themselves were contacted to determine current pricing.\item[$\bullet$]The opinion of value expressed in this Appraisal Report is the result of and is subject to the data and research described in detail in the Appraisal Report.\item[$\bullet$]This Appraisal Report, or a copy of this Appraisal Report, may be transmitted to a third party or legal entity only in its entirety and only with the expressed written consent of the appraisal client.\item[$\bullet$]Information furnished by the owner regarding property history is believed to be reliable; however, no warranty is given for its accuracy.\item[$\bullet$]The appraiser assumes no responsibility for unforeseen changes in market conditions, nor is the inability to locate a potential buyer or replacement item, at the appraised value, if such is attempted by the client or any other person.\item[$\bullet$]In the event of a dispute involving interpretation or application of this report, the ASA recommends that such a dispute shall be referred to a neutral third-party mediation service. The cost of such mediation shall be borne equally by both parties. In the event mediation is not successful, the parties should agree to submit the dispute to binding arbitration under the laws of the State of California.\item[$\bullet$]The appraiser has personally inspected the subject property. The opinion of value expressed in the Appraisal Report is the result of and is subject to the data and research described in detail in the Appraisal Report and on data retained in our files. The appraisers have not knowingly withheld any significant information.\item[$\bullet$]Appraisers witness, identify and value subject property but do not claim authentication of the subject properties, unless otherwise noted.\item[$\bullet$]This Appraisal Report is valid only for the intended use, intended users and for the type of value stated in the appraisal. The values reported in this appraisal are valid only on the effective date of the appraisal, September 15, 2014.\item[$\bullet$]In researching comparable sales for the subject properties focus was on researching realized sales that occurred prior to the effective date of this appraisal. In some cases sales were considered that occurred after the effective date in order to provide direction in identifying market trends near the effective date and to identify whether other comparable sales were anomalies within the market.\item[$\bullet$]The submission of this report completes the assignment and obligations. Any further consultation, preparation of additional reports, testimony, or appearances in court or before any governmental forum in reference to the property described in this appraisal will require additional fees to cover the required services.\item[$\bullet$]In this appraisal many of the furniture, furnishings and residential contents were reported to have been purchased in 2006. The purchase date may not consistency reflect the date the item was created so in many cases a date of 20th/21st Century was stated to reflect a short date of creation range that roughly translates to circa date 1990-2010.\item[$\bullet$]Prior to beginning the inspection the appraiser and client agreed to appraise items with an individual value exceeding \$500 or a group of similar items (such as electronics) with a collective value exceeding \$500. For this reason some items in the home were not valued as part of this appraisal. A few exceptions to the \$500 threshold were included in the appraisal report as judged by the appraiser. These exceptions were due to pieces of “notable” presence in the home that may have been noticeably missing from the appraisal as judged by the appraiser or items where the valued was undetermined at the time of inspection and only discovered during the research phase at which point the appraiser included them because the appraisal process had already been completed.\item[$\bullet$]An exact match to year and model of the majority of electronics was found in either ebay realized sales or UsedPrice.com (Blue Book of electronic values). In cases where the exact year and model of the electronic could not be located, the closest model and year of the electronic was used as a value substitution. In some instances the electronics in the home were mounted or difficult to move. In these cases an exact model of electronic may not have been able to be identified.\item[$\bullet$]Photographs of inspected items are available separate from the report. Not every piece that was inspected has a photograph included in the report. Over 600 photographs were taken during the inspection process, most were included in the appraisal document but some were omitted. In addition, the comparable sales noted in the report were retained as part of the work file but images of these pieces were not included in the appraisal report. Pertinent sales data was noted in the market analysis section of the document.\item[$\bullet$]Comparable sales used in this appraisal as well as appraised values were rounded to the nearest dollar.\end{compactitem}\newpage{}\section{Certification}
The appraisers certify and agree that:\begin{compactitem}\item[$\bullet$]To the best of my knowledge and belief, the statements of fact in this report are true and correct. The value conclusions are based on my background and experience outlined in the credentials attached to this report.\item[$\bullet$]The reported analyses, opinions and conclusions are limited only by the reported assumptions and limiting conditions.

\begin{description}\item[Excellent:] The object's stability and state of preservation (i.e. wear and/or losses to paper, decoration, pigment, chips etc.) exhibits stable condition or integrity; function or artistic intent is structurally sound; no restoration material added and no significant repairs.
\item[Very Good:] State of preservation is near original condition; object exhibits stabilization/conservation possibly reflecting slight deterioration from original function or artistic intent.  Structural integrity is maintained.  Some repairs are evident and unobtrusive; no restoration, i.e. all original material.
\item[Good:] State of preservation exhibits clearly its original function and artistic intent, however, the object shows considerable wear.  Stabilization, conservation, restoration reflect original function and maintain artistic intent and structural integrity.  Restoration and repairs are evident; i.e. there may be added material; or, repairs may be needed.
\item[Fair:] State of preservation shows considerable wear and deterioration yet still indicates the general nature of its original form; the object may need structural stabilization, conservation, restoration and/or repairs.
\item[Poor:] State of preservation indicates substantial deterioration compromising original form; the object needs structural stabilization, conservation, restoration and/or repairs.

\end{longtable}\paragraph{Description:}
A large pointillist painting in a modern style depicting the faces of the four Beatles. This painting positions the Beatles in closeup portrait with the composition heavily using black, pink and aqua coloring.\paragraph{Market Analysis:}
No realized sales were found for this artist. The retail asking prices he publishes on his website range from \$1,250 to \$17,000. Due to the lack of realized sales, other contemporary artists with realized sales with similar style and prominence were investigated.


An oil on canvas by Paul Sierra created in 2008, sized 30 x 42 sold for \$3,100 on December 2, 2009 at Artists in Auction. This painting depicts a nude swimmer in a pool. The painting is in the modern style and Paul Sierra is a listed artist with 6 recorded sales.


A painting by Tim Neil also in the modernist style depicting Cary Grant failed to sell on April 4, 2014 at Jean Marc Gallery for a \$3,000-6,000 estimate. It was sized 18 1/4" x 20 1/4“/


Peter Keil painted an abstract portrait of the Beatles sized 41 3/4" x 41 1/4" which sold at Midwest Auction Galleries for \$900 on November 17, 2013. Keil is an abstract modernist painter with a significant auction record.


A well known artist, Peter Max sold a painting of Ringo Starr sized 19 1/2" x 23 1/2" for \$5,500 on August 23, 2014. While this painting is smaller than the subject property, it does have similar subject matter and Peter Max is a well known and highly collected artist.


Finally, an acrylic on canvas set of four paintings, each measuring 36" x 36" failed to sell on March 14, 2014 at Wyatt Auctions for \$1,000-1,500. This painting was painted by artist Pietro Psaier.


The subject property is much larger than the comparables but Tim McWilliams is not as well known or highly collected as some of these other artists. While the other paintings are similar in style, none of the other artists are pointillist painters. Based on the sales prices and unsold pieces of these other artists and the subject property, the fair market value for this painting is \$2,500.

A 1980 version of the Atari standup arcade game Centipede. The game has fully working display with operational electronics and controls.\paragraph{Market Analysis:}
Several realized sales were found for this vintage arcade game. On August 7, 2011 one sold for \$275 at California Auctioneers \& Appraisers. On December 9, 2006 it was sold for \$475 at Sunflower Auction. On July 29, 2014 one sold for \$400 on ebay and on June 22, 2014 one sold for \$256 on ebay but this one has defects. More weight was given to recent sales that occcurred on ebay and the subject property in this appraisal appears to be in good working condition without major defects to the screen or cabinet.\paragraph{Fair Market Value: }

A group of approximately 171 DVD movies of various titles. The movies appear to be mainstream, popular movies with some in boxed sets but mostly individual theatrical DVDs in jewel cases.\paragraph{Market Analysis:}
A lot of 191 movies sold on ebay for \$200 on July 23, 2014. Another lot of 171 movies sold on August 28, 2014 for \$207.50. Another lot of 150+ movies (including box sets) sold for \$86 on September 5, 2014. It appears that DVDs sell in a loose range of roughly 75 cents to \$1 for standard DVDs (not Blu-Ray or 3D versions). Prices vary depending on the desirability of the movie titles, box sets (which are 1 box but may contain multiple movies) and other factors. The movies in the subject property are considered popular movies with a limited number of boxed sets which collectively do not sell for as much as individual movies. These DVDs are being valued at 85 cents per movie.\paragraph{Fair Market Value: }

\end{longtable}\paragraph{Description:}
A table made from a floor piece of the United Center after the 1996, 1997, 1998 championship years, along with four chairs assumed to be court side seats from the same years. All are dedicated to John Harris, Jr. The chairs have red and white vinyl upholstery in red metal chair frames. The floor is encased in a black painted wood table framework.\paragraph{Market Analysis:}
A 6" x 6" piece of the Chicago Stadium floor sold for \$75 on ebay on July 28, 2014. Another piece of floor with Certificate of Authenticity sold for \$89 on August 13, 2014 on ebay. This piece was also 6" x 6“. On October 29, 2011 another piece of floor sold at Bunte Auction Services for \$25, there is no explanation for this lower comparable and it appears to be an outlier value that does not reflect the market.


A courtside United Center chair sold at Tory Hill Auction Co. on June 30, 2012 for \$175.


The subject property consists of four similar chairs and a much larger section of floor over 43" x 43" and presented in a table frame. Based on the very large size of the floor which is set into a table frame along with four chairs, all together in one collectible set of sports collectibles, the fair market value for this collection is: \$2,000.00.

A set of 5 barstools sold for \$850 at Palm Beach Modern Auctions on November 30, 2013.


Another comparable set of barstools advertised at North Shore Exchange, a designer furniture and clothing resale store, consists of three designer barstools for \$375.00.

A set of six contemporary blue suede chairs were sold at Clars Auction house for \$275 on July 12, 2009. The sofa in this appraisal is one of Il Loft’s iconic pieces and a centerpiece for a room. Due to these qualities this sofa enjoys a premium in the marketplace. Although this sofa retails for asking prices ranging from \$6,000 and higher, the fair market value of the piece being approximately 8 years old is considerably less.


Another contemporary sectional sofa by DellRobbia in black and red upholstery with a similar style but less complexity failed to sell on November 13, 2013 at Shelly’s Auction Gallery. At Treadway/Toomey on December 3, 2006 a black modern section made by Red Lion Furniture sold for \$950. Finally a Rolf Benz sofa sold for \$1,400 on January 1, 2013 at Kimball Sterling Auctions. The subject property was similar in quality and style to this sofa but superior in presentation to all the other comparables.

\end{longtable}\paragraph{Description:}
A Caille blue and silver 5 cent slot machine with one right side arm, nickel slot and double payout ramps. The slot machine is scratched and the plastic front has been damaged. Believed to be the Dough Boy Bell model but this machine has similarities to the Cadet model as well. The damage to the front of the machine prevents absolute identification.\paragraph{Market Analysis:}
A similar Caille Cadet 1930s 5 cent slot sold on ebay on August 27, 2104 for \$398. This one was similar in color and model. Another sold at Government Auction on January 1, 2010 for \$1,900. This comparable was black in color but otherwise the same model. A third Caille Dough Boy Bell machine, in the 10 cent model but the same bodice sold for \$750 on April 30, 2005 at Rich Penn Auctions. A final 5 cent Caille machine sold for \$1,500 at Morphy Auctions at their Victorian Casino Antiques sale. This had similar look but a more art deco exterior design. Taking into account the poor condition of this machine and the comparable sales and venues, the fair market value for this slot machine is \$625.00.\paragraph{Fair Market Value: }

\item[$\bullet$]Muscle Dynamics Maxicam Weight Rack
\item[$\bullet$]Exercise Mats
\end{compactitem}\paragraph{Market Analysis:}
These large Nautilus Nitro professional machines vary in the realized prices they sell for due to various factors including condition, upkeep and additional deliver fees incurred when purchasing online. Since these pieces are weights, the shipping costs can be extensive. One Nautilus Nitro bicep curl machine sold on ebay on July 24, 2014 for \$500 with local pickup only. No shipping was offered. Another machine in slightly better condition with recent servicing sold for \$1,295 with extra fees for shipping. Many other pieces offered for sale failed to sell in the \$1,500 and higher range. The machines varied in their value depending on size, amount of weight and desirability of the particular machine (in addition to the above stated characteristics of value).


A Hammer Strength MTS Abdominal Crunch machine in similar form sold on ebay for \$1,295. A smaller adjustable incline/decline sit-up bench sold for \$395.


Most of the machines appear to have retail values in the \$3,000-5,000 range with resale prices ranging from \$500-1,300. Since there are limited realized sales, an average of \$1,000 per machine is being used. The machines in this appraisal are in very good condition with upgraded seat and pad covers. The decline sit up bench has no weights and is valued at \$395.00.

Many comparable sales of bedroom suites were found that sold at auction. This collection is not marked so a maker was not attributed to this collection.

\end{longtable}\paragraph{Description:}
An Egyptian Sultanibad hand-knotted rug from Egypt and constructed on a cotton foundation, both warp \& weft and a 100\% imported wool pile. This rug is made of all hand-carded, hand-spun high quality wool and is combined with all vegetable dyes which provide the antique or vintage look in this newer rug. A Persian Sultanabad design is featured with oversized large floral motif and soft, subtle color tones.\paragraph{Market Analysis:}
A larger Persian Sultanabad sized 10’ x 12’ 5" sold at Clars on January 23, 2011 for \$2,750. The subject property has better coloring but is smaller. Another carpet that sold for \$3,200 at New Orleans Auction Company on December 8, 2013 was sized 8’ 1" x 10’ was larger but not as desirable in color as the subject property. Finally a passed lot on June 16, 2013 from Grogan \& Company with an estimate of \$3,000 to \$5,000 was much larger with good coloring. Based on these comparables and cross-consultation with rug expert Brian Shanley, the fair market value for this carpet is: \$2,750.00.


In 1883, Ziegler and Co. of Manchester, England, established a Persian carpet workshop in Sultanabad, Iran, an area known as Arak. Ziegler \& Co. employed designers from major western department stores, such as B. Altman \& Co. in New York and Liberty of London, to adapt and re-color traditional sixteenth and seventeenth century Safavid designs for the more restrained western taste. In addition, traditional local dying techniques were improved, creating new possibilities in color and tonality. With bold, allover patterns and softer palettes than their vibrant Persian counterparts, antique Persian Sultanabad rugs and carpets attracted an immediate following leading to a demand for oriental carpets from the Sultanabad district. Subsequently, until the early twentieth century a large number of oriental rugs were exported from Persia to both Europe and America. Stylistically, antique Sultanabad rugs are still regarded as the most appealing to European and American tastes.

On April 8, 2006 a pair of ebonized Michael Taylor armchairs sold at San Rafael Auctions for \$800. The armchairs in this appraisal are superior in form, inlay and quality. Michael Taylor Designs is a high end furniture designer and these chairs display considerable inlay and quality wood. Retail listings for these chairs were found in the range of \$3,500 to \$6,000.

\end{longtable}\paragraph{Description:}
An oil painting depicting a woman on the balcony of a building in partial profile with a red scarf on her head and a yellow ribbon in her hand.


Hughie Lee-Smith was born in 1911 in Eustis, Florida. He moved with his mother to Cleveland, Ohio when he was ten years old. His work of the 1930s was characterized by a gently expressionistic social realism reminiscent of Ben Shahn. In 1937 he won a scholarship to the Detroit Society of Arts and Crafts. In 1947 after studying at the Cleveland Institute of the Arts, working under the Works Progress Administration, teaching college art courses and serving as an artist for the United States Navy, he found himself working in a Ford foundry.


It was not long before he began to paint in a more energetically primitivist style. In 1958 he moved to New York City and taught at the Art Students League for fifteen years. He became an associate member of the National Academy in 1963 and a full member in 1967. He was the second black member to be named, after Henry Tanner. In 1994 he was commissioned to paint the official City Hall portrait of then mayor David Dinkins. Lee-Smith died on February 23, 1999 at the age of eighty-three.

\paragraph{Market Analysis:}
A 12 x 9 painting of an individual figure in profile on a building sold at Swann Galleries on October 7, 2010 for \$4,800. A 10 x 16 portrait of a girl sold on October 27, 2012 at Dan Ripley’s Auctions for \$3,750. A larger 28 x 20 profile of a figure sold at Treadway/Toomey on December 7, 2013 for \$18,300. This last comparable was much larger and a more complete and realized composition. The painting in this appraisal is most closely comparable to comparable \#1.\paragraph{Fair Market Value: }

\end{longtable}\paragraph{Description:}
A still life watercolor painting of fruit on compote dish resting on a table.


Born in a small town near Venice, Italy, Louis Bosa became a genre, figure, and landscape painter who exhibited widely, and was also a much-respected art teacher. Amidst the growing trends of modernism, especially Abstract Expressionism, he kept to his own unique style of apolitical, witty character studies and subjects of humor and human pathos. For art historians, his work has been difficult to categorize, which has led to him getting less attention than many of his contemporaries, especially those who had sophisticated public-relations machines. Also, he was such a unique character—ever telling jokes and far-fetched stories—that the focus on him tended to be on his quirky personality rather than the seriousness of his art. Louis Bosa died in Doylestown, Pennsylvania on October 19, 1981 at age 76.

\paragraph{Market Analysis:}
On March, 20 2014 a floral still life oil on board sized 18 x 14 sold at Alderfer Auction Company for \$497. A 10 x 16 oil on board sold at Alderfer Auction Company on December 10, 2010 for \$293. The subject property is smaller than the comparables and a watercolor instead of an oil painting. His works are high in quality but his market and collectibility has never been exceedingly high.\paragraph{Fair Market Value: }

\end{longtable}\paragraph{Description:}
A color etching that depicts circus performers juggling. The artwork employs blue, yellow and red coloring to convey a playful image.


Georges Rouault was born on May 27, 1871 in a Paris cellar to which his mother had been carried after the house had been struck by a stray shell during an insurrection. His father was a cabinet-maker in a piano factory. His paternal grandfather was a lover of art, an admirer of Manet and Daumier, who hoped the child would become a painter. When Rouault was a teenager he was apprenticed to a stained glass maker. This early contact with stained glass influenced immensely his later career as painter and printmaker. At the same time he attended evening classes at the Ecole des Arts Decoratifs, and studied painting at the Louvre. He became the favorite pupil and a close friend of Gustave Moreau.


In 1908, Rouault married Martha Le Sidoner. They had four children. Rouault exhibited with the Fauves, though he was never closely associated with that movement. His work from then until the end of his life was concerned with printmaking, designing costumes and scenery, illustrating books, etc.

\paragraph{Market Analysis:}
A color aquatint sized 12 1/8 x 8 1/2 is being offered on September 29, 2014 at Leslie Hindman for an estimate of \$800 to \$1,200.

David Sutherland is considered a high end designer of furniture and his pieces sell for a premium on the retail market. The secondary market sales for Sutherland’s pieces are significantly lower than the retail prices. In addition, a few of the subject chairs display repairs where the seat supports were glued. These chairs are constructed of wood with a modern aesthetic which are still in fashion in the design market. These chairs have a fair market value of \$175 each with the two damaged chairs at \$100.

\end{longtable}\paragraph{Description:}
Egyptian Sultanabad 9.3x12.1, hand-knotted in Egypt and constructed on a cotton foundation, both warp \& weft and a 100\% imported wool pile. This rug is made of all hand-carded, hand-spun high quality wool and is combined with all vegetable dyes which provide the rug with an antique or vintage look in a newer rug. A Persian Sultanabad design is featured with oversized large floral motif and soft, subtle color tones.\paragraph{Market Analysis:}
A Persian Sultanabad was sold on October 11, 2009 for \$4,000 at New Orleans Auction. It was a 9’ x 12’ rug in various shades of brown. It is larger than the subject property but not as desirable in color. Another example sold for \$3,250 on July 12, 2008 at Neal Auction Company. It displays good colors and is sized 8’ x 11’. It is smaller but comparable in color. The date of the sale however in 2008 was a more difficult market for selling these items. Finally a rug sold for \$3,600 on November 14, 2010 at New Orleans Auctions, a 10’ x 13" also displaying good coloring. Based on the comparables and current market, the fair market value of this rug is \$3,750.


In 1883, Ziegler and Co. of Manchester, England, established a Persian carpet workshop in Sultanabad, Iran, an area known as Arak. Ziegler \& Co. employed designers from major western department stores, such as B. Altman \& Co. in New York and Liberty of London, to adapt and re-color traditional sixteenth and seventeenth century Safavid designs for the more restrained western taste. In addition, traditional local dying techniques were improved, creating new possibilities in color and tonality. With bold, allover patterns and softer palettes than their vibrant Persian counterparts, antique Persian Sultanabad rugs and carpets attracted an immediate following leading to a demand for oriental carpets from the Sultanabad district. Subsequently, until the early twentieth century a large number of oriental rugs were exported from Persia to both Europe and America. Stylistically, antique Sultanabad rugs are still regarded as the most appealing to European and American tastes.

An oil on canvas painting depicting a town scene with a road leading up toward a group of buildings. The composition uses bright green, taupe and brown coloring with a blue sky.

May 24, 2014 a 14 1/2 x 17 1/2 work by Estivalet sold at Millea Bros Auctions for \$700. On May 20, 2013 a lot remained unsold at BFA Auctions for an oil sized 21 1/4 x 25 1/2 inches. Another Estivalet painting sold for \$2,250 on November 20, 2004 at Creighton-Davis Gallery. On ebay on July 27, 2014 an oil painting sold for \$550.

Another Khorassan rug sold for \$10,000 at Nazmiyal Auctions. The rug is sized 11’ 16” x 16’ 9“. This rug is also quite large with good coloring. Both rugs sold on May 22, 2014. A third rug sold on December 8, 2008 for \$10,000 sized 18’ 7” x 11’ 9" at DuMouchelles Auction. These rugs are all Khorassan rugs with various sizes and motifs.

A dark wood sculpture in the form of a water pitcher with affixed small metal and brass decorations in the form of animals, common objects and other items. The metal decorations are nailed into the wooden pitcher.


Claudia DeMonte is known for her analysis of contemporary women’s roles. Her most recent exhibition, “The Luxury of Exercise,” commented on the idea that exercise in America is, for the most part, a leisure activity requiring free time and financial means. DeMonte’s travels around the world exposing her to different cultures where exercise is integral to making a living or carrying on with daily life. A mixed media artist, DeMonte currently focuses on bronze sculptures representing feminist themes.

\paragraph{Market Analysis:}
Jean Albano Gallery is listing the retail price of an artwork depicting a purse with similar decorations at \$5,000 to \$10,000. Cole Pratt Gallery advertises a Shoe Form Female Fetish in the same mode with an asking price of \$6,000. While the artist DeMonte is a personality in the art world and artist of some note, there are no recorded sales records for DeMonte’s works that present a fair market value. The fair market value for this work was determined by examining other artist that produce similar works and the differential between the gallery retail level and the fair market value for similar pieces.\paragraph{Fair Market Value: }

A wool blanket of unknown origin, possibly Argentinian or African. This blanket is rectangular in form dominated by red coloring with green perimeter stripes and four square green blocks with red diamonds in the center of the blanket.\paragraph{Market Analysis:}
Valuations for this piece are difficult without an origin or artist to work from. For these reasons, this work is being valued as a decorative item and is researched based on its appeal to collectors in this area.


Three specialists were contacted to ascertain the origins of this rug. Three specialists felt that this rug was not Native American, North American or Central American. It is thought that the origins may be African or Argentinian. It is possible that it is a weaver with influences from many regions. The specialists consulted were experts in Native American textiles and generalist textile experts.


The strip weave aspect is very similar to West African weaving but the only places where they use dyed wool is in Mali and Niger and they don’t use these colors.


Another possibility is that this blanket could be the work of a western weaver inspired by African or other weaving. The size is not something that is recognized as an ethnographic textile for the materials used.


For these reasons the textile is being valued for its decorative appeal. Other works from various regions were found to have sold that represent Mexican, African and South American pieces that have sold for between \$100 to \$600 in many cases. The value assigned to this piece is: \$375.00.

\end{longtable}\paragraph{Description:}
A painting in stylized form of a girl ironing her hair. The painting employs heavy use of oil paint to create an imposing canvas. The figure in the painting is standing and ironing her hair. There is text writing in the body of the canvas in red paint. The overall coloring of the painting uses blue, gray, red and yellow. Signed verso.


Candida Alvarez was born in Brooklyn, New York on February 2, 1955. Her parents came to the United States from Puerto Rico in the 1950s. She studied at Fordham University, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1977, and Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in 1981. Alvarez’ art aims at personal and cultural symbols, narrative, everyday artifacts, abstraction and representation that coexist in her multipaneled compositions.


Alvarez and her husband, Dawoud Bey, a photographer, have been artists-in-residence at the Phillips Academy Addison Gallery of American Art.

\paragraph{Market Analysis:}
Sales records for Alvarez are relatively limited. The records do exist provide information that the market for the artist is relatively low. Christie’s New York sold a 33 3/4" x 22 3/4" painting on April 4, 2012 for \$63. It had an original estimate of \$700 to \$900. Artspace is advertising a print by Alvarez for a \$200 asking price. Rachel Davis sales for a triptych lithograph provide interesting insight into the Alvarez market through the sale of the same piece in 2006 and 2012. In 2006 the triptych sold for \$200 and in 2012 the same artwork sold for \$60.


The subject property is much larger and a superior work of art than the comparables listed above. While her paintings do not enjoy very high prices this is one of the nicer works in the portfolio items found. Based on estimate of \$700 to \$900 from Christie’s and the subsequent sale of the piece, this work is being valued both as a decorative artwork as well as a piece from a known artist with comparables. The decorative appeal alone warrants a higher value than the comparable sales taken alone.

Both works are larger than the subject property although all three are landscapes. There is a large discrepancy for the two sales. It is unclear why the one work sold for such a low value. The more recent sale was given more weight in this valuation.
