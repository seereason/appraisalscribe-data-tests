\end{longtable}Dear Ms. McCluskey:

According to our contract signed by you on January 30, 2014, I have prepared the following report for three paintings by Edward Heiple. You provided me with the information that indicates that the you own the subject property listed above in its entirety. I examined the property in the your presence at the above address.


This appraisal report provides the appraisal conclusion of Replacement Value-Comparable for the intended use of Insurance. In this report, \emph{Replacement Value - Comparable} refers to the price in terms of cash or other precisely revealed terms that would be required to replace a property with another of similar age, quality, origin, appearance, provenance and condition within a reasonable length of time in an appropriate and relevant market (from American Society of Appraisers Personal Property Committee, Monograph \#2, Type of Value, 2010.) Please note that this appraisal and the concluded Replacement Value-Comparable are only for purchasing insurance coverage.


This report will function as documented evidence of this appraiser having witnessed the subject property, and identified, described and valued the subject property in the context of estimating Replacement Value-Comparable.


After thorough consideration of available facts and statistics, on January 30, 2014, the Replacement Value-Comparable for the subject property is \textbf{twenty three thousand eight hundred five dollars (\$23,805)}. The effective date of value for this appraisal is January 30, 2014. This figure does not reflect a consideration for related sales taxes and delivery/installation charges, which can vary. This professional opinion is based upon my knowledge and experience in the valuation of fine arts. This appraisal is based on my research and analysis of the property and knowledge of relevant markets where the properties are traded.


This report was prepared to conform to the Code of Ethics of the American Society of Appraisers and the current version of the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice, published by the Appraisal Foundation. I have no past, present or contemplated future interest in the properties included in this report. My fee was not contingent on any value finding.


This \pageref{LastPage} page report consists of a letter of transmittal, scope of work, definitions, privacy statement, assumptions and limiting conditions, certification, description, photographs, narrative, glossary, bibliography and credentials. All these elements must be present for the value conclusion to be valid.


The information in this report is confidential. All notes, electronic, work copies and photographs remain the property of the appraiser and are retained for five years, and/or two years after the conclusion of any litigation. All documents are shredded or otherwise defaced prior to disposal.


The submission of this report completes my assignment and obligations. Any further consultation, preparation of additional reports, testimony, or appearances in court or before any governmental forum in reference to the properties described in this appraisal will require additional fees to cover the required services. The aforementioned fees will be billed at the rate commensurate with the timing of the appraisal.


Thank you for allowing me to be of service to you.

\authorsignature\newpage{}\newpage{}\section{Scope of Work}
Thompson \& Martinez Fine Art Appraisals, Inc. was hired by Joanne McCluskey to reach an opinion of the Replacement Value-Comparable of three paintings by Edward Heiple. Based on my discussion with the Client, as well as the intended use of the report, the type and location of the subject properties and the effective date of valuation, the Appraiser has selected the type of value, the relevant market, the information researched and the analysis to be applied. To complete this assignment I consulted authoritative publications and on-line sources, reviewed published and on-line market data and interviewed the artist and others regarding the subject property and its relevant market.


This report is intended to be an objective, independent, unbiased and credible analysis of known facts. During the course of my examination, research and analysis, I have endeavored to be accurate and to use due diligence. This opinion of value was developed using appraisal methods that are within the accepted standard of care for the appraisal profession and within the boundaries of typical practice.


This appraisal document summarizes the information analyzed, the appraisal procedures followed, and the reasoning that supports the analysis, opinions and conclusions under the requirements of the \emph{Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice, the 2014-2015 Edition} (USPAP). The documentation substantiating the value reported is held in the appraiser’s files.

\newpage{}\section{Type of Value}
This report serves a documented evidence of this Appraiser having witnessed the subject property and identified, described and valued the subject property in the context of determining Replacement Value - Comparable.\section{Intended Use}
The intended use of this report is to evaluate the subject property and provide an assessment of its Replacement Value - Comparable for the purpose of obtaining insurance coverage. No other use of this report is valid or condoned.\section{Intended Users of this report}
The intended users of this report are: \textbf{Joanne McCluskey and the Insurance Company}. There are no other intended users or uses.\section{Definition of Value}
\emph{Replacement Value - Comparable} is the price required to replace a property with another of similar age, quality, origin, appearance, and condition, within a reasonable length of time in an appropriate and relevant market (from American Society of Appraisers Personal Property Committee, Monograph \#2, Type of Value, 2010.) Intangible provenance value is additive when appropriate.


Because of the time element involved, the appropriate market for replacement is deemed to be that of primary sources, such as art galleries carrying comparable and immediately available personal properties. If the only source for replacement can be demonstrated to be that of auction, that is the source utilized. Replacement Value is used as the basis for insurance purposes and damage/loss reports.

\section{Approaches to Value}
For this appraisal three valuation methods were considered (from Soucy and Smith, eds, \emph{The Appraisal of Personal Property – Principles, Theories, and Practice Methods for the Professional Appraiser}, 1994.). The three valuation methods are:\begin{compactitem}\item[$\bullet$]\textbf{Cost Approach to Value} method estimates either the reproduction or replacement of a property, either new or depreciated.\item[$\bullet$]\textbf{Income Approach to Value} method estimates the present worth of anticipated future benefits of owning income producing properties or objects.\item[$\bullet$]\textbf{Market Comparison Approach to Value} method estimates value by comparison with properties sold in the relevant market with adjustments for all differences that affect value, such as differences in characteristics of value, in market layer, and in time exposed to the market in order to arrive at the most apposite estimate of value.\end{compactitem}The Market Comparison Approach was chosen for this assignment. In this case the Cost and Income Approaches to value were also considered but determined not to be appropriate to this assignment. Although the Cost Approach would be able to replicate the subject property in form, it would not represent the age of the sculpture and the concomitant additional desirability of this work. The Income Approach also was not appropriate because an income cannot be derived from these properties. Therefore the value conclusion of this property is based on market data and comparable sales, taking into consideration the differences that affect value cited above. Market data in this case includes primary retail asking prices and on-line secondary retail data. Sources are listed in the report.\newpage{}\section{Privacy Policy}
Thompson \& Martinez Fine Art Appraisals, Inc. is committed to keeping all appraisal-related data confidential in compliance with the current version of the \emph{Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice, the 2014-2015 Edition} (USPAP) as published by The Appraisal Foundation and relevant federal and state laws.

\begin{description}\item[Excellent:] The object's stability and state of preservation (i.e. wear and/or losses to paper, decoration, pigment, chips etc.) exhibits stable condition or integrity; function or artistic intent is structurally sound; no restoration material added and no significant repairs.
\item[Very Good:] State of preservation is near original condition; object exhibits stabilization/conservation possibly reflecting slight deterioration from original function or artistic intent.  Structural integrity is maintained.  Some repairs are evident and unobtrusive; no restoration, i.e. all original material.
\item[Good:] State of preservation exhibits clearly its original function and artistic intent, however, the object shows considerable wear.  Stabilization, conservation, restoration reflect original function and maintain artistic intent and structural integrity.  Restoration and repairs are evident; i.e. there may be added material; or, repairs may be needed.
\item[Fair:] State of preservation shows considerable wear and deterioration yet still indicates the general nature of its original form; the object may need structural stabilization, conservation, restoration and/or repairs.
\item[Poor:] State of preservation indicates substantial deterioration compromising original form; the object needs structural stabilization, conservation, restoration and/or repairs.

\paragraph{Market Overview}

According to Artprice, which analyzes sales at the auction level of the market, “Contemporary art has never known such glory in the United States.” (“Contemporary Art Market,” 2013). At the high end of the market, American artists have the highest price index in the world, and American auction records were “exceptional” in 2013. Modern and contemporary art dominated in market share, with 20th century artists dominating the upper end of the market. Although confidence has returned to the very top-end of the market, since the downturn in 2008, recovery at the low and mid-level markets has been more inconsistent, depending in part on whether the artist has a regional, national or global market. In some cases, prices remain depressed or flat for works by artists who have a regional market presence while the prices for works by artists with a national or global market have been generally more robust.


In the current market, quality, reputation and rarity are key elements of value.  The fame or recognition an artist receives is due not only to the quality and uniqueness of the work, but also to interest by museums, critics and galleries, who exhibit and publish their work, drawing collector attention.


The subject properties are three paintings by Edward Heiple, a mid career regional artist based in Ithaca, in upper New York State. The artist paints with acrylic gels on acrylic sheets. His work is abstract, featuring compositions with organic shapes and repeating forms rendered with a translucent mosaic effect due in part to his use of jewel tone acrylic gels. Heiple has exhibited his work at local venues such as Cornell University in 2008 and 2013, which received local media coverage, but does not appear to have received much recognition beyond the regional level. Heiple does not currently appear to have gallery representation and sells his work directly from the studio.


As of the date of the report, correspondence was initiated with the artist, but the artist had not yet responded to an inquiry regarding his recent sales. At present there is no basis to conclude that the Replacement Value - Comparable of the subject properties has declined since the works were purchased in 2007 and 2008. According to a representative of the State of the Art Gallery in Ithaca, NY–a cooperative artist-owned gallery–commissions have increased and prices have risen by more than 15\% for many artists in the region during the past two years. The Appraiser is of the opinion that the original purchase price of the works documented by the owner, plus 15\% increase, is a reasonable basis for the current Replacement Value - Comparable conclusions stated on the following pages.
