It dates from the 1940s when Zhang Daqian famously went to the Buddhist caves at Dunhuang in Gansu Province to study and produce paintings after the Buddhist subjects there. According to Mr. Chang, Buddhist deity  paintings produced in this period rarely appeared at auction prior to 2009, so this work would have been very fresh to the market in September of 2008. \n\nA search of auction records yielded three similar era and subject matter paintings. A \"Figure of a Bodhisattva\" copied from a Buddhist mural at the Mogao Caves at Dunhuang sold through Beijing Rongbao Auctions on May 15th, 2005 for US$172,705. Like the subject property, it depicts a standing deity and has a single line inscription stating that it is modeled after a Tang period mural. On April 25th, 2004 a painting depicting a standing Guanyin with a single line inscription indicating that is also from this period, signed and with two seals of the artist sold through Christie's Hong Kong for $US151,763 (Figure 3). Another painting from this period, \"Guanyin on a Lotus Seat\", 1944, sold through Sotheby's Hong Kong on May 1st, 2005 for $489,231 (Figure 4). It is a larger more elaborate painting with a long inscription by the artist at the top and is signed and has three seals of the artist. \n\nOf these three paintings, the subject property is most similar to the \"Figure of Bodhisattva\" (Figure 2). Both paintings feature a standing deity rendered in colors in an archaic style, and have a single line inscription identifying the subject and its location and that the artist copied directly from a Tang Dynasty mural. Therefore the realized sale of this painting is the basis of the Fair Market Conclusion of the subject property.\n\n1.
